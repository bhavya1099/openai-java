================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The method 'createFineTuningJob' is exposed as public without any authentication mechanism in place. This could allow unauthorized access to the function, potentially leading to misuse or data breaches.
Solution: Ensure that all critical functions require authentication before execution. Implement an authentication mechanism to verify the identity of the user before allowing access to sensitive functions.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: In case of an error, the 'execute' method might throw an exception that could reveal sensitive information about the system or the code. This could provide valuable information to an attacker.
Solution: Implement a global exception handler that catches all exceptions and logs them. Return a generic error message to the user without revealing any sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: The code does not limit the number of requests that can be made to the 'createFineTuningJob' function. This could potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker makes a large number of requests.
Solution: Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests a client can make within a specified time period. This can help prevent DoS attacks by limiting the resources a single user can consume.

""" 
Scenario 1: Test Successful FineTuningJob Creation

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulFineTuningJobCreation.
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful creation of a FineTuningJob using a valid FineTuningJobRequest. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid FineTuningJobRequest object. 
  Act: Invoke createFineTuningJob with the valid FineTuningJobRequest object. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned FineTuningJob object is not null and its properties match those of the FineTuningJobRequest.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks that a FineTuningJob is created successfully when a valid request is provided. It verifies that the application can create a FineTuningJob as expected.


Scenario 2: Test FineTuningJob Creation with Invalid Request

Details:  
  TestName: testFineTuningJobCreationWithInvalidRequest.
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createFineTuningJob method when an invalid FineTuningJobRequest is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an invalid FineTuningJobRequest object (e.g., missing required fields). 
  Act: Invoke createFineTuningJob with the invalid FineTuningJobRequest object. 
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the application throws an exception when an invalid request is used to create a FineTuningJob. This is important to maintain data integrity and prevent the creation of invalid FineTuningJobs.


Scenario 3: Test FineTuningJob Creation with Null Request

Details:  
  TestName: testFineTuningJobCreationWithNullRequest.
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createFineTuningJob method when a null FineTuningJobRequest is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the input is null. 
  Act: Invoke createFineTuningJob with null as the argument. 
  Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the application throws a NullPointerException when null is used as the request. This helps prevent null pointer exceptions during runtime.
