================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: The method convertExceptionToMessage outputs the entire error message. This could potentially include sensitive information, such as file paths, server names, or other backend details, especially when exceptions are not properly sanitized before logging.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is not included in exception messages. Consider creating custom exception classes that only include non-sensitive information in their messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The method convertExceptionToMessage directly uses the exception's message to create a ChatMessage. If exception messages contain sensitive information, this could lead to information exposure.
Solution: Sanitize the exception messages to avoid revealing sensitive information. Use a logging mechanism to log the detailed error messages for debugging, but only show generic messages to the users.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If the error message contains untrusted data and is later used in an SQL command, this could lead to SQL Injection attacks.
Solution: Even though it's not directly related to this code snippet, it's important to always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection when the error message is used in an SQL command.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Valid Exception Message
Details:  
  TestName: testForValidExceptionMessage
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method is able to successfully convert a valid exception message into a ChatMessage.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Exception with a custom message.
    Act: Invoke the convertExceptionToMessage method with the created Exception.
    Assert: Verify that the returned ChatMessage contains the custom exception message.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the exception message is correctly converted into a ChatMessage. This is significant for ensuring that exception messages are accurately captured and reported.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Exception Message
Details:  
  TestName: testForNullExceptionMessage
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles an Exception with a null message.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Exception without a message.
    Act: Invoke the convertExceptionToMessage method with the created Exception.
    Assert: Verify that the returned ChatMessage contains the string representation of the Exception.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method is able to handle Exceptions with null messages and still provide a meaningful ChatMessage. This is important for ensuring robust error handling.

Scenario 3: Test for Empty Exception Message
Details:  
  TestName: testForEmptyExceptionMessage
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles an Exception with an empty message.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Exception with an empty message.
    Act: Invoke the convertExceptionToMessage method with the created Exception.
    Assert: Verify that the returned ChatMessage contains the string representation of the Exception.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method is able to handle Exceptions with empty messages and still provide a meaningful ChatMessage. This is important for ensuring robust error handling.

Scenario 4: Test for Exception Message with Special Characters
Details:  
  TestName: testForExceptionMessageWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles an Exception message that includes special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Exception with a message that includes special characters.
    Act: Invoke the convertExceptionToMessage method with the created Exception.
    Assert: Verify that the returned ChatMessage contains the custom exception message with special characters.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles special characters in exception messages. This is important for ensuring that all types of exception messages can be accurately converted into a ChatMessage.
