================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If the application constructs SQL statements using raw user input, it may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks that can lead to data leakage, data manipulation, or even remote code execution.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries or ORM libraries to handle SQL commands. Avoid constructing SQL queries using string concatenation with raw user input.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If the application uses unsanitized user input in web page generation, it may be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS can lead to session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of the site, and other serious attacks.
Solution: Use context-dependent output encoding libraries when displaying user input. Apply Content Security Policy (CSP) as an additional layer of protection.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: An attacker can manipulate a path used in file operations to access files or directories that are outside of a restricted directory. This can lead to sensitive information exposure, or even remote code execution if the attacker can reach system directories.
Solution: Use library calls that explicitly forbid path traversal. If user input is used to construct any part of a file path, ensure that it's properly sanitized and validated.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Detailed error messages can expose sensitive information about the application's inner workings, which can be used by an attacker to craft more specific attacks.
Solution: Ensure that error messages displayed to the user are generic and do not leak any sensitive information. Log detailed error messages server-side where they can be properly protected.

  Scenario 1: Test Successful Creation of Embeddings

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulCreationOfEmbeddings.
    Description: This test aims to validate the successful creation of embeddings when provided with a valid EmbeddingRequest object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid EmbeddingRequest object.
    Act: Invoke the createEmbeddings method with the valid EmbeddingRequest object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned EmbeddingResult object is not null and contains the expected values.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the createEmbeddings method successfully creates embeddings when given a valid EmbeddingRequest. The expected result is based on the assumption that the method should return a valid EmbeddingResult when provided with a valid request.

  Scenario 2: Test Creation of Embeddings with Null Request

  Details:  
    TestName: testCreationOfEmbeddingsWithNullRequest.
    Description: This test aims to verify the method's behavior when a null EmbeddingRequest object is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the EmbeddingRequest object as null.
    Act: Invoke the createEmbeddings method with the null EmbeddingRequest object.
    Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the createEmbeddings method throws an exception when provided with a null EmbeddingRequest. The expected result is based on the assumption that the method should not accept null requests and should instead throw an exception.

  Scenario 3: Test Creation of Embeddings with Invalid Request

  Details:  
    TestName: testCreationOfEmbeddingsWithInvalidRequest.
    Description: This test aims to verify the method's behavior when an invalid EmbeddingRequest object is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an invalid EmbeddingRequest object.
    Act: Invoke the createEmbeddings method with the invalid EmbeddingRequest object.
    Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the createEmbeddings method throws an exception when provided with an invalid EmbeddingRequest. The expected result is based on the assumption that the method should not accept invalid requests and should instead throw an exception.

  Scenario 4: Test Handling of API Errors during Embeddings Creation

  Details:  
    TestName: testHandlingOfApiErrorsDuringEmbeddingsCreation.
    Description: This test aims to verify the method's error handling capability when the API returns an error during the embeddings creation process.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the API to return an error when createEmbeddings is invoked.
    Act: Invoke the createEmbeddings method with a valid EmbeddingRequest object.
    Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the createEmbeddings method properly handles API errors during the embeddings creation process. The expected result is based on the assumption that the method should throw an exception when the API returns an error.

  Scenario 5: Test Handling of Network Issues during Embeddings Creation

  Details:  
    TestName: testHandlingOfNetworkIssuesDuringEmbeddingsCreation.
    Description: This test aims to verify the method's error handling capability when there are network issues during the embeddings creation process.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Simulate network issues during the invocation of the createEmbeddings method.
    Act: Invoke the createEmbeddings method with a valid EmbeddingRequest object.
    Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the createEmbeddings method properly handles network issues during the embeddings creation process. The expected result is based on the assumption that the method should throw an exception when there are network issues.
