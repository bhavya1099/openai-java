Test generated by RoostGPT for test java-junit4-test using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

1. Positive Scenario: Test with a valid purpose and a valid filepath. The file should be uploaded successfully and a File object should be returned.

2. Negative Scenario: Test with a valid purpose but an invalid filepath. The test should throw an exception, indicating that the file was not found.

3. Negative Scenario: Test with an invalid purpose but a valid filepath. The purpose of the file upload might not be recognized, and an error message should be returned.

4. Negative Scenario: Test with both an invalid purpose and an invalid filepath. The test should throw an exception, indicating that the file was not found and the purpose was not recognized.

5. Positive Scenario: Test with a valid purpose and a filepath that points to a large file. The file should be uploaded successfully and a File object should be returned.

6. Negative Scenario: Test with a valid purpose but a filepath that points to a file that does not have read permissions. The test should throw an exception, indicating that the file cannot be read.

7. Boundary Scenario: Test with a valid purpose and a filepath that points to a file that is exactly at the maximum allowed size limit. The file should be uploaded successfully and a File object should be returned.

8. Negative Scenario: Test with a valid purpose and a filepath that points to a file that is larger than the maximum allowed size limit. The test should throw an exception, indicating that the file is too large.

9. Edge Case: Test with a valid purpose but a filepath that is null. The test should throw a NullPointerException.

10. Edge Case: Test with a null purpose but a valid filepath. The functionality of the method under a null purpose should be checked.

11. Edge Case: Test with both a null purpose and a null filepath. The test should throw a NullPointerException.

12. Positive Scenario: Test with a valid purpose and a filepath that points to a non-text file (e.g., an image or a binary file). The file should be uploaded successfully and a File object should be returned, if the function supports non-text files.

13. Negative Scenario: Test with a valid purpose and a filepath that points to a directory, not a file. The test should throw an exception, indicating that the provided path is a directory and not a file.

14. Negative Scenario: Test with a valid purpose and a filepath that points to a file, but the file is currently being used by another process. The test should throw an exception, indicating that the file is currently in use.
