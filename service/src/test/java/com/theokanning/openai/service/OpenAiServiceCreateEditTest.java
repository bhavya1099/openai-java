================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: This vulnerability occurs when an application includes user-supplied data in an SQL query without appropriately escaping it. An attacker can modify the query structure and control the database.
Solution: Use PreparedStatements, which are precompiled SQL statements that are safer and usually enhance performance.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: This vulnerability occurs when an application includes user data in a webpage without properly validating or escaping it, allowing an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the browser of the victim.
Solution: Ensure to validate and sanitize user input and use output encoding libraries when rendering user-supplied input.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: This vulnerability happens when sensitive information is revealed to users, which should not have been disclosed. This can give attackers more understanding about the system and can help them in finding more vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure to protect sensitive information and only show necessary information to the users.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The software does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.
Solution: Ensure to implement proper authentication mechanisms before allowing the user to access critical functionalities.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: The software transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.
Solution: Ensure to use secure communication channels like HTTPS to transmit sensitive information.

"""
Scenario 1: Successful Edit Creation

TestName: testSuccessfulEditCreation
Description: This test ensures that the 'createEdit' method can successfully create an edit when provided with a valid EditRequest.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid EditRequest object.
  Act: Invoke the 'createEdit' method with the EditRequest.
  Assert: Verify that the returned EditResult is not null and matches the expected output.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the 'createEdit' method correctly creates an edit when provided with a valid request. This test is significant as it confirms the primary functionality of the 'createEdit' method.

Scenario 2: Edit Creation with Null Request

TestName: testEditCreationWithNullRequest
Description: This test checks the 'createEdit' method's behavior when invoked with a null EditRequest.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the request is null.
  Act: Invoke the 'createEdit' method with a null EditRequest.
  Assert: Verify that the method throws an appropriate exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the 'createEdit' method correctly handles a null request by throwing an exception. This test is significant as it validates the method's error handling capabilities.

Scenario 3: Edit Creation with Invalid Request

TestName: testEditCreationWithInvalidRequest
Description: This test verifies how the 'createEdit' method handles an EditRequest that contains invalid data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an EditRequest object with invalid data.
  Act: Invoke the 'createEdit' method with the invalid EditRequest.
  Assert: Verify that the method throws an appropriate exception or returns an error response.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the 'createEdit' method correctly handles an invalid request by either throwing an exception or returning an error response. This test is significant as it confirms the method's ability to handle erroneous inputs.

Scenario 4: Edit Creation when API is Unavailable

TestName: testEditCreationWhenApiIsUnavailable
Description: This test checks the 'createEdit' method's behavior when the underlying API is unavailable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the API to simulate unavailability.
  Act: Invoke the 'createEdit' method with a valid EditRequest.
  Assert: Verify that the method throws an appropriate exception or returns an error response.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the 'createEdit' method correctly handles API unavailability by either throwing an exception or returning an error response. This test is significant as it confirms the method's resilience against external failures.
