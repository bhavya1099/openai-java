================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The function 'retrieveFile' is publicly accessible which might lead to unauthorized access to sensitive file data.
Solution: Consider limiting the visibility of the 'retrieveFile' function, or implement an authentication mechanism to ensure only authorized users can access the function.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The function 'retrieveFile' does not perform any user authentication, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Solution: Implement an authentication mechanism before allowing access to the 'retrieveFile' function to ensure only authorized users can access it.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: The function 'retrieveFile' might consume a lot of resources if it's called multiple times simultaneously, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
Solution: Implement rate limiting or use a queue system to control the number of requests processed by the 'retrieveFile' function at the same time.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: If the 'fileId' parameter comes from user input and is used to construct a URL, there might be a risk of URL Redirection attack.
Solution: Validate and sanitize the 'fileId' parameter before using it to construct a URL.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: If the 'execute' function throws an exception, it might expose sensitive information through error messages.
Solution: Implement a global exception handler that catches exceptions and replaces sensitive information in error messages with generic messages.

"""
  Scenario 1: Successful Retrieval of File

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulFileRetrieval
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly retrieves a file when a valid file ID is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the api.retrieveFile method to return a valid file when a specific file ID is passed as an argument.
    Act: Invoke the retrieveFile method with the specific file ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned file matches the mock file.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly interacts with the API to retrieve a file. The expected result is that the method should return the file that matches the provided file ID.

  Scenario 2: File ID Not Found

  Details:  
    TestName: testFileIdNotFound
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles the scenario where a file ID that doesn't exist in the system is passed. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the api.retrieveFile method to return null or throw an exception when a non-existent file ID is passed.
    Act: Invoke the retrieveFile method with a non-existent file ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns null or throws the expected exception.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies how the method handles error scenarios, specifically when a file ID that doesn't exist in the system is used. The expected result is that the method should either return null or throw an exception.

  Scenario 3: Null File ID

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullFileId
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles the scenario where a null file ID is passed. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this scenario.
    Act: Invoke the retrieveFile method with a null file ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method throws a NullPointerException.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies how the method handles error scenarios, specifically when a null file ID is used. The expected result is that the method should throw a NullPointerException.
