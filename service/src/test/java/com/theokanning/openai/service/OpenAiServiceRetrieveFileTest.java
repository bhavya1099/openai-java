================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The function 'retrieveFile' is publicly accessible which might lead to unauthorized access to sensitive file data.
Solution: Consider limiting the visibility of the 'retrieveFile' function if it's not necessary to be public. Use the least privilege principle.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Leakage
Issue: In case of an exception, detailed internal error information may be exposed which can be helpful for an attacker.
Solution: Consider using a global exception handler to catch and process all exceptions in a standardized way. Avoid returning or logging sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The code doesn't check permissions when accessing a file. Therefore, it might access files that should be restricted.
Solution: Implement a permission check before accessing a file. Consider using Java's SecurityManager to check read permission.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: If the file size is very large, it might consume too much memory and lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).
Solution: Consider checking the file size before processing it. If it's too large, reject the request or process the file in chunks.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The method 'execute' is exposed and may be dangerous if it allows arbitrary code execution or access to sensitive data.
Solution: Review the 'execute' method to ensure it doesn't expose any dangerous functionality. If necessary, limit its visibility or add authentication or validation.

  Scenario 1: Successful Retrieval of File

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulFileRetrieval
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly retrieves a file when a valid file ID is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the api.retrieveFile method to return a valid file when a specific file ID is passed as an argument.
    Act: Invoke the retrieveFile method with the specific file ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned file matches the mock file.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly interacts with the API to retrieve a file. The expected result is that the method should return the file that matches the provided file ID.

  Scenario 2: File ID Not Found

  Details:  
    TestName: testFileIdNotFound
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a situation where a non-existent file ID is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the api.retrieveFile method to throw an exception when a non-existent file ID is passed as an argument.
    Act: Invoke the retrieveFile method with the non-existent file ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that an exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles a situation when a file ID does not exist. The expected result is that the method should throw an exception.

  Scenario 3: Null File ID

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullFileId
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a situation where a null file ID is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to setup any data, mocks, or test doubles.
    Act: Invoke the retrieveFile method with a null file ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that an exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles a situation when a null file ID is provided. The expected result is that the method should throw an exception.

  Scenario 4: Empty File ID

  Details:  
    TestName: testEmptyFileId
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a situation where an empty file ID is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to setup any data, mocks, or test doubles.
    Act: Invoke the retrieveFile method with an empty file ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that an exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles a situation when an empty file ID is provided. The expected result is that the method should throw an exception.
