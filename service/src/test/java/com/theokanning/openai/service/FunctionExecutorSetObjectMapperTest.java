================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The ObjectMapper class in the code is used for deserializing data, which might lead to executing arbitrary code when deserializing untrusted data.
Solution: Avoid deserialization of untrusted data. If it's necessary, use a safe deserialization strategy such as whitelisting of classes that can be deserialized or use of custom deserializer.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the ObjectMapper is misused, it can lead to unintended exposure of private information. For instance, if it's configured to ignore private fields or methods, it can expose them.
Solution: Ensure that the configuration of ObjectMapper is correct and only the necessary fields are exposed. Also, avoid using global instances of ObjectMapper as they can lead to unintended side effects.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not perform any validation on the input that is used to create or modify the JsonNode objects. This might lead to various types of injection attacks.
Solution: Validate all input data before using it. Use a library or framework that automatically escapes special characters to prevent injection attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: If an error occurs while processing the Json, the system might expose sensitive information through error messages.
Solution: Handle errors gracefully and avoid providing detailed error messages that could help an attacker. Use generic error messages instead.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid ObjectMapper Input Test

Details:  
  TestName: testSetObjectMapperWithValidInput
  Description: This test is designed to check if the setObjectMapper method correctly assigns the given ObjectMapper instance to the MAPPER variable. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid ObjectMapper instance.
  Act: Call the setObjectMapper method with the created ObjectMapper instance.
  Assert: Use a getter method for the MAPPER field (if available) to check if the MAPPER field is equal to the used ObjectMapper instance.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies whether the MAPPER field was correctly set by the setObjectMapper method. This is crucial because the MAPPER field is likely used in other parts of the program to handle JSON processing tasks.

Scenario 2: Null ObjectMapper Input Test

Details:  
  TestName: testSetObjectMapperWithNullInput
  Description: This test is designed to check if the setObjectMapper method correctly handles a null input, without throwing any unexpected exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a null value as an argument.
  Act: Call the setObjectMapper method with null as the parameter.
  Assert: Use a getter method for the MAPPER field (if available) to check if the MAPPER field is null.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the setObjectMapper method can handle null inputs gracefully. This is essential as passing null to the method may occur due to programming errors or runtime issues.

Scenario 3: Multiple ObjectMapper Input Test

Details:  
  TestName: testSetObjectMapperWithMultipleInputs
  Description: This test is designed to check if the setObjectMapper method correctly assigns the latest ObjectMapper instance when called multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different ObjectMapper instances.
  Act: Call the setObjectMapper method first with the first instance, then with the second instance.
  Assert: Use a getter method for the MAPPER field (if available) to check if the MAPPER field equals the second ObjectMapper instance.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies whether the MAPPER field was updated correctly with the latest ObjectMapper instance. This is important to ensure that the setObjectMapper method can be called multiple times without issues.
