================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The 'setObjectMapper' method allows for the injection of an ObjectMapper instance from an external source. If not properly validated, an attacker could provide a maliciously configured ObjectMapper, leading to unexpected behavior or information disclosure.
Solution: Ensure the ObjectMapper instance is validated before use. If possible, avoid accepting ObjectMapper instances from external sources, and instead, create and configure them within the class itself.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The 'setObjectMapper' method is public and can be accessed from outside the class. This can lead to potential security risks if it is used improperly or maliciously.
Solution: Limit the visibility of the method to the minimum necessary. If it is only required within the class, make it private. If it is required in the same package, make it package-private.

Vulnerability: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
Issue: The ObjectMapper could be used to parse user-controlled JSON input. If the size of the input is not checked, this could lead to a buffer overflow.
Solution: Always validate and check the size of the input before using the ObjectMapper to parse it.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The ObjectMapper could be used to parse user-controlled JSON input. If the input is not properly validated, this could lead to various forms of injection attacks.
Solution: Always validate the input before using the ObjectMapper to parse it. Use a whitelist of allowed characters and reject any input that does not match.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid ObjectMapper Input Test

Details:  
  TestName: testSetObjectMapperWithValidInput
  Description: This test is designed to check if the setObjectMapper method correctly assigns the given ObjectMapper instance to the MAPPER variable. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid ObjectMapper instance.
  Act: Call the setObjectMapper method with the created ObjectMapper instance.
  Assert: Use a getter method for the MAPPER field (if available) to check if the MAPPER field is equal to the used ObjectMapper instance.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies whether the MAPPER field was correctly set by the setObjectMapper method. This is crucial for ensuring that the MAPPER is correctly initialized and ready for further operations.

Scenario 2: Null ObjectMapper Input Test

Details:  
  TestName: testSetObjectMapperWithNullInput
  Description: This test is meant to check how the setObjectMapper method handles null input. Depending on the implementation, it should either assign null to the MAPPER field or throw an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are passing null.
  Act: Call the setObjectMapper method with null.
  Assert: Depending on the expected behavior, check if an exception was thrown or if the MAPPER field was set to null.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies the method's behavior when null input is given. This is important as it checks the robustness of the code in cases of unexpected input.

Scenario 3: ObjectMapper Reassignment Test

Details:  
  TestName: testSetObjectMapperReassignment
  Description: This test checks if the setObjectMapper method can correctly handle the reassignment of the MAPPER field.
Execution:
  Arrange: First, create and set an ObjectMapper instance. Then, create a second ObjectMapper instance.
  Act: Call the setObjectMapper method again, this time with the second ObjectMapper instance.
  Assert: Use a getter method for the MAPPER field (if available) to check if the MAPPER field is equal to the second ObjectMapper instance.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the setObjectMapper method can correctly handle reassignments. This is important for ensuring the MAPPER field can be updated if needed.
