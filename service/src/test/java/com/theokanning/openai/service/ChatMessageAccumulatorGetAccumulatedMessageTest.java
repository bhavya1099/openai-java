================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insufficient Data Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: If the 'ChatMessage' object contains sensitive data and is directly exposed to the client without proper validation, it could lead to potential security risks such as information disclosure.
Solution: Ensure that all data is properly validated before being returned to the client. Sensitive data should be encrypted or removed where necessary.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR, CWE-639)
Issue: If the 'ChatMessage' object is associated with a specific user or session and if the reference to this object is exposed, it could lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Implement proper access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access the specific 'ChatMessage' instances. Avoid exposing direct references to such objects.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if getAccumulatedMessage returns the correct message.
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetAccumulatedMessage.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getAccumulatedMessage method returns the correct accumulated message. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a ChatMessage object with a known message.
    Act: Invoke the getAccumulatedMessage method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome (the known message).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the getAccumulatedMessage method returns the correct message. The expected result is the known message, as that's what's been initialized in the ChatMessage object. This test is significant in ensuring the method retrieves the correct message.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if getAccumulatedMessage returns null when no message has been set.
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetAccumulatedMessageReturnsNull.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getAccumulatedMessage method returns null when no message has been set. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as no message has been set.
    Act: Invoke the getAccumulatedMessage method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the result is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the getAccumulatedMessage method returns null when no message is set. The expected result is null, as no message has been set. This test is significant in ensuring the method handles null values correctly.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if getAccumulatedMessage returns the latest message when multiple messages have been set.
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetAccumulatedMessageWithMultipleMessages.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getAccumulatedMessage method returns the latest message when multiple messages have been set. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize multiple ChatMessage objects with known messages.
    Act: Invoke the getAccumulatedMessage method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome (the latest message).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the getAccumulatedMessage method returns the latest message when multiple messages have been set. The expected result is the latest message. This test is significant in ensuring the method retrieves the correct message when multiple messages are involved.
