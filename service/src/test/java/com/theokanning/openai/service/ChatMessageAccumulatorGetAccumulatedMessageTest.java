================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: If the object returned by 'getAccumulatedMessage' contains sensitive data and is directly exposed to the user, it could lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Apply appropriate access control checks before returning the object. Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to ensure only necessary data is sent to the user.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through an Error Message or CWE-209
Issue: If exceptions are not handled properly and are propagated up the call stack, it could potentially expose sensitive data or system details to the user.
Solution: Use a global exception handler to catch and handle all exceptions. Ensure that error messages are generic and do not reveal any sensitive system information.

Vulnerability: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data or CWE-311
Issue: If the 'accumulatedMessage' contains sensitive data and is not encrypted, it could be exposed during transit or at rest.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm. Use HTTPS for data in transit and at rest use Java's built-in encryption libraries or trusted third-party libraries.

"""
Scenario 1: Validate the return of accumulatedMessage object

Details:  
  TestName: testReturnOfAccumulatedMessage.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getAccumulatedMessage() returns the correct accumulatedMessage object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there are no input parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getAccumulatedMessage() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned object against the expected accumulatedMessage object.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAccumulatedMessage() method correctly retrieves the accumulatedMessage object. The expected result is that the returned object matches the expected accumulatedMessage object. This test is significant as it ensures the method properly retrieves the accumulatedMessage object, which is vital for communication in the application.

Scenario 2: Validate the return of null when no accumulatedMessage exists

Details:  
  TestName: testNullReturnWhenNoAccumulatedMessageExists.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getAccumulatedMessage() returns null when there is no accumulatedMessage. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there are no input parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getAccumulatedMessage() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAccumulatedMessage() method correctly returns null when there is no accumulatedMessage. The expected result is that the returned object is null. This test is significant as it ensures the method is capable of handling situations where no accumulatedMessage exists.

Scenario 3: Validate the return of accumulatedMessage object after it is updated

Details:  
  TestName: testReturnOfAccumulatedMessageAfterUpdate.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getAccumulatedMessage() returns the correct accumulatedMessage object after it has been updated. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Update the accumulatedMessage object.
  Act: Invoke the getAccumulatedMessage() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned object against the updated accumulatedMessage object.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAccumulatedMessage() method correctly retrieves the updated accumulatedMessage object. The expected result is that the returned object matches the updated accumulatedMessage object. This test is significant as it ensures the method properly retrieves the updated accumulatedMessage object, which is crucial for maintaining accurate communication in the application.
