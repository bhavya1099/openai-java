================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Libraries
Issue: The application uses a large number of libraries which could contain vulnerabilities. Third-party libraries can introduce security vulnerabilities if they are not kept up-to-date or configured incorrectly.
Solution: Regularly update all libraries used in the application to their latest secure versions. Use tools like OWASP Dependency Check to identify any known vulnerabilities in the libraries.

Vulnerability: Insecure Deserialization
Issue: The application uses Jackson library for deserialization, which can be exploited to perform arbitrary code execution if not properly configured.
Solution: Use Jackson's built-in defenses against deserialization attacks. For example, configure ObjectMapper to prevent the deserialization of arbitrary types.

Vulnerability: Data Leakage
Issue: The application's error messages could potentially leak sensitive information, making it easier for an attacker to exploit other vulnerabilities.
Solution: Avoid exposing exception stack traces or other sensitive information to the end user. Instead, log this information server-side where it can be reviewed by a system administrator.

"""
Scenario 1: Test when request is successfully processed and stream of ChatCompletionChunk is returned.

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulChatCompletionStream.
  Description: This test case is meant to check if a stream of ChatCompletionChunk is returned successfully when a valid ChatCompletionRequest is passed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid ChatCompletionRequest.
  Act: Invoke the streamChatCompletion method with the created request. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Flowable<ChatCompletionChunk> is not null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if a stream of ChatCompletionChunk is returned. The expected result is a non-null Flowable<ChatCompletionChunk> because a valid request has been passed. This test is significant to ensure the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test when request is null.

Details:  
  TestName: testNullChatCompletionRequest.
  Description: This test case is meant to check the behavior of the method when a null request is passed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a null as ChatCompletionRequest.
  Act: Invoke the streamChatCompletion method with the null request. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if a NullPointerException is thrown. The expected result is a NullPointerException since null is passed as request. This test is significant to ensure the method handles null inputs appropriately.

Scenario 3: Test when request processing fails.

Details:  
  TestName: testFailedChatCompletionRequestProcessing.
  Description: This test case is meant to check the behavior of the method when the request processing fails. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the api.createChatCompletionStream method to throw an exception.
  Act: Invoke the streamChatCompletion method with a valid request. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the appropriate exception is thrown. The expected result is an exception since the processing of the request fails. This test is significant to check the error handling capability of the method.

Scenario 4: Test when request is processed but no ChatCompletionChunk is returned.

Details:  
  TestName: testEmptyChatCompletionStream.
  Description: This test case is meant to check the behavior of the method when the request is processed but no ChatCompletionChunk is returned. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the api.createChatCompletionStream method to return an empty stream.
  Act: Invoke the streamChatCompletion method with a valid request. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Flowable<ChatCompletionChunk> is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if an empty stream is returned. The expected result is an empty stream since the method processing doesn't return any ChatCompletionChunk. This test is significant to ensure the method handles such scenarios correctly.
