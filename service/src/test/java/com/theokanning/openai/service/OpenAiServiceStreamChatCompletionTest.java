================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Leakage Through an Error Message
Issue: Verbose error messages can expose sensitive information about the internal workings of the application or system.
Solution: Ensure that error handling reveals minimal information and doesn't leak sensitive data. Always log the detailed error message internally and show a generic error message to the user.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Without proper input validation, an attacker can inject malicious data leading to attacks such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Remote Code Execution.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize input data. Use prepared statements for SQL queries. Use output encoding when displaying user content.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: Sensitive data sent over unencrypted channels can be intercepted and read by attackers.
Solution: Always use encryption when transmitting sensitive data. In the context of web applications, always use HTTPS for communication.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Information exposure occurs when system data or debugging information could be useful in an attack but is exposed to users, often in error messages.
Solution: Ensure error messages returned to the user do not reveal any sensitive information or information about the internal workings of the application.

"""
Scenario 1: Test when request is successfully processed and stream of ChatCompletionChunk is returned.

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulChatCompletionStream.
  Description: This test case is meant to check if a stream of ChatCompletionChunk is successfully returned when a valid ChatCompletionRequest is passed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid ChatCompletionRequest.
  Act: Invoke the streamChatCompletion method with the created request. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Flowable<ChatCompletionChunk> is not null.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if a stream of ChatCompletionChunk is successfully returned. The expected result is a non-null Flowable<ChatCompletionChunk> indicating successful completion of the method. This test is significant for the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test when a null request is passed to the method.

Details:  
  TestName: testNullChatCompletionRequest.
  Description: This test case is meant to check if the method throws an exception when a null ChatCompletionRequest is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a null ChatCompletionRequest.
  Act: Invoke the streamChatCompletion method with the null request. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method throws a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the method throws an exception when null is passed instead of a ChatCompletionRequest. The expected result is a NullPointerException indicating that the method does not handle null arguments. This test is significant for error handling.

Scenario 3: Test when request is not set to stream.

Details:  
  TestName: testChatCompletionRequestNotSetToStream.
  Description: This test case is meant to check if the method modifies the request to set it to stream.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a ChatCompletionRequest and do not set it to stream.
  Act: Invoke the streamChatCompletion method with the created request. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the request is set to stream after invoking the method.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the method modifies the request to set it to stream. The expected result is that the request is set to stream after invoking the method. This test is significant for ensuring the functionality of the method.

Scenario 4: Test when the API fails to create a chat completion stream.

Details:  
  TestName: testFailureToCreateChatCompletionStream.
  Description: This test case is meant to check if the method handles the scenario when the API fails to create a chat completion stream.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the API to simulate a failure when createChatCompletionStream is invoked.
  Act: Invoke the streamChatCompletion method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method throws an exception.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the method throws an exception when the API fails to create a chat completion stream. The expected result is an exception indicating that the method handles API failures. This test is significant for error handling.
