================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Path Traversal (CWE-22)
Issue: The code accepts a file path as a parameter and uses it to create a new file. This can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the file path, potentially leading to unauthorized read or write access to arbitrary files on the system.
Solution: Validate and sanitize the input file path. Ensure that it does not contain relative paths. Use a library or built-in function to safely join paths. Consider using a whitelist of acceptable paths.

Vulnerability: Insecure File Upload (CWE-434)
Issue: The code allows for file uploads without adequate checks, which can lead to execution of malicious files or overwrite of critical files.
Solution: Implement checks to validate the file type and size. Consider scanning the file for malware. Restrict the file upload location and do not use user input to construct the file path. Ensure that uploaded files cannot be executed on the server.

Vulnerability: Missing Error Handling (CWE-391)
Issue: The code does not have error handling for file operations. If an error occurs during file upload, it may fail silently, leading to a potential denial of service or incorrect program behavior.
Solution: Implement appropriate error handling for file operations. This can include checking the success of the operation and handling exceptions.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The code may potentially expose sensitive data in error messages or logs. If an error occurs during file upload, sensitive data about the system or file contents may be exposed.
Solution: Ensure that error messages do not contain sensitive data. Consider using a logging library that can mask sensitive data. Implement a proper logging and error handling mechanism.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Successful File Upload

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulFileUpload
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful upload of a file with the correct purpose and filepath. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock API response for successful file upload. Create a valid file and purpose.
  Act: Invoke the uploadFile method with the appropriate purpose and filepath parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned File object against the mock API response.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly uploads the file and returns the expected File object. This test is critical to ensure that the file upload functionality works as expected.

Scenario 2: Test File Upload With Invalid Filepath

Details:  
  TestName: testFileUploadWithInvalidFilepath
  Description: This test is meant to check the method's behavior when an invalid filepath is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock API response for a file upload error. Create a valid purpose and an invalid filepath.
  Act: Invoke the uploadFile method with the appropriate purpose and invalid filepath parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method throws an exception when an invalid filepath is provided. This test is significant to ensure that the method appropriately handles invalid input.

Scenario 3: Test File Upload With Null Purpose

Details:  
  TestName: testFileUploadWithNullPurpose
  Description: This test is meant to check the method's behavior when a null purpose is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock API response for a file upload error. Create a null purpose and a valid filepath.
  Act: Invoke the uploadFile method with the null purpose and valid filepath parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method throws an exception when a null purpose is provided. This test is significant to ensure that the method appropriately handles null inputs.

Scenario 4: Test File Upload With Empty Purpose

Details:  
  TestName: testFileUploadWithEmptyPurpose
  Description: This test is meant to check the method's behavior when an empty purpose is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock API response for a file upload error. Create an empty purpose and a valid filepath.
  Act: Invoke the uploadFile method with the empty purpose and valid filepath parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception or a specific error response.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns an error or throws an exception when an empty purpose is provided. This test is significant to ensure that the method appropriately handles empty inputs.
