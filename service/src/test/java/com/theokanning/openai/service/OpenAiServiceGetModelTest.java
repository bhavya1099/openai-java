================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Dependencies (CWE-829)
Issue: The use of outdated or insecure third-party libraries can expose the application to vulnerabilities present in these libraries. This is a common security issue in applications that heavily rely on external dependencies, such as this one.
Solution: Regularly update all dependencies to their latest stable version. Additionally, use tools to automatically check for known vulnerabilities in the dependencies. For Java, examples of such tools include OWASP Dependency-Check and Snyk.

Vulnerability: Hard-Coded Secrets (CWE-798)
Issue: If there are any API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive information hard-coded into the application, it could lead to serious security breaches if the code is ever exposed or decompiled.
Solution: Never hard-code sensitive information. Use environment variables or secure configuration files to handle these, and ensure they are properly protected with appropriate file permissions.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: Without proper input validation, the application could be vulnerable to a variety of injection attacks, such as SQL injection or command injection, depending on what the input is used for.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize all user input. Do not trust data received from any untrusted source. Consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection if the input is used in a database query.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling (CWE-209)
Issue: If the application does not properly handle errors, it may reveal sensitive information in error messages that can be used by an attacker to exploit the application.
Solution: Ensure that error messages are user-friendly and do not expose any sensitive information or internal workings of the application. Log detailed error information server-side where it can be reviewed by developers.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to ensure the getModel method returns the correct model for a given modelId.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetModelReturnsCorrectModel.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getModel method when provided with a valid modelId. It ensures that the correct Model object is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the api.getModel method to return a specific Model object when provided with a specific modelId. 
  Act: Invoke getModel with the specific modelId.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Model object matches the expected Model object.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getModel method correctly retrieves and returns the Model object corresponding to the given modelId. The expected result is that the returned Model object should match the Model object returned by the mocked api.getModel method. This test is significant as it ensures the getModel method correctly retrieves and returns the correct Model object based on the modelId.

Scenario 2: Test to ensure the getModel method returns null when provided with an invalid modelId.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetModelReturnsNullForInvalidModelId.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getModel method when provided with an invalid modelId. It ensures that null is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the api.getModel method to return null when provided with an invalid modelId. 
  Act: Invoke getModel with the invalid modelId.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Model object is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getModel method correctly handles invalid modelIds and returns null. The expected result is that the returned Model object should be null. This test is significant as it ensures the getModel method correctly handles invalid modelIds.

Scenario 3: Test to ensure the getModel method throws an exception when provided with a null modelId.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetModelThrowsExceptionForNullModelId.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getModel method when provided with a null modelId. It ensures that an exception is thrown.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are providing a null modelId. 
  Act: Invoke getModel with a null modelId.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getModel method correctly handles null modelIds and throws an exception. The expected result is that an exception is thrown. This test is significant as it ensures the getModel method correctly handles null modelIds.
