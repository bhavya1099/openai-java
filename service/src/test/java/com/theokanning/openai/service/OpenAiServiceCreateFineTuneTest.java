================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: If the application is not careful about the permissions assigned to created files, it could leave sensitive data exposed to other users or processes on the same system.
Solution: Ensure that file permissions are explicitly set to a safe default when creating files. Limit the permissions as much as possible to restrict unauthorized access.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If the application constructs SQL queries using raw user input, an attacker could manipulate the queries to retrieve, alter, or delete data.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries, or ORM libraries to ensure all user input is properly sanitized before it is included in a SQL query.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: If the application includes user input in its responses without sanitizing it, an attacker could inject scripts that will be executed in the user's browser.
Solution: Use output encoding libraries to ensure all user input is properly escaped before it is included in an HTTP response.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: If the application does not validate or improperly validates input, an attacker could supply crafted input to disrupt application processing, leading to a variety of impacts.
Solution: Ensure that all user input is validated before it is processed. Use a denylist/allowlist approach to reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: If the application exposes sensitive information in error messages or HTTP responses, an attacker could use this information to craft more targeted attacks.
Solution: Ensure that error messages do not leak sensitive information. Use custom error pages or catch exceptions to prevent the leakage of system details.

"""
Scenario 1: Fine Tune Request is Successful

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulFineTuneRequest
  Description: This test is meant to check if the fine tune request is successfully processed and a valid FineTuneResult is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the api.createFineTune method to return a valid FineTuneResult.
  Act: Invoke the createFineTune method with a valid FineTuneRequest.
  Assert: Assert that the returned FineTuneResult is not null and matches the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that a valid FineTuneResult is returned when a valid FineTuneRequest is passed. This is important to ensure that the fine tuning process works as expected.

Scenario 2: Fine Tune Request is Null

Details:  
  TestName: testNullFineTuneRequest
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method handles a null FineTuneRequest gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to mock anything in this scenario.
  Act: Invoke the createFineTune method with a null FineTuneRequest.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that an exception is thrown when a null FineTuneRequest is passed. This is important to ensure that the method validates its input parameters.

Scenario 3: API Call Throws an Exception

Details:  
  TestName: testApiCallException
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method handles exceptions thrown by the api.createFineTune method gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the api.createFineTune method to throw an exception.
  Act: Invoke the createFineTune method with a valid FineTuneRequest.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is caught and handled.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that exceptions thrown by the api.createFineTune method are caught and handled appropriately. This is important to ensure that the method is resilient to failures in the underlying API.

Scenario 4: Fine Tune Request Contains Invalid Data

Details:  
  TestName: testInvalidFineTuneRequestData
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method handles a FineTuneRequest with invalid data gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the api.createFineTune method to return a validation error.
  Act: Invoke the createFineTune method with a FineTuneRequest containing invalid data.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate error is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that a validation error is returned when a FineTuneRequest with invalid data is passed. This is important to ensure that the method validates the data in the FineTuneRequest.
