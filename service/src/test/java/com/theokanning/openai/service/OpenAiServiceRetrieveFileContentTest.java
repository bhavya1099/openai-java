ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=retrieveFileContent_9ecba71b2b

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The method retrieveFileContent(String fileId) does not seem to implement any form of authentication or authorization. An attacker might be able to access sensitive file content if they know the fileId.
Solution: Implement an appropriate authentication and authorization scheme. Ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access file content.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The fileId could potentially be used to traverse the file system and access restricted directories.
Solution: Validate and sanitize the fileId input to prevent path traversal attacks. Consider using an allowlist of accepted inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: If the file content is large, there might be a risk of resource exhaustion which can lead to Denial of Service (DoS).
Solution: Implement resource usage limits or quotas. Consider streaming the file content instead of loading it all into memory at once.

Vulnerability: CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
Issue: The code uses third-party libraries, which might have vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the security of the application.
Solution: Regularly update all third-party libraries to the latest versions. Consider using a software composition analysis tool to identify and track third-party vulnerabilities.

"""
Scenario 1: Retrieve File Content with Valid ID

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveFileContentWithValidId
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the retrieveFileContent method when provided with a valid file ID. It ensures that the method can successfully retrieve the content of the file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid file ID that exists in the system.
  Act: Invoke the retrieveFileContent method with the valid file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the ResponseBody returned is not null and contains the expected file content.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method is capable of retrieving the content of a file when provided with a valid file ID. The expected result is the content of the file, which confirms that the method works as intended.

Scenario 2: Retrieve File Content with Invalid ID

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveFileContentWithInvalidId
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the retrieveFileContent method when provided with an invalid file ID. It ensures that the method handles this scenario correctly, likely by throwing an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an invalid file ID that does not exist in the system.
  Act: Invoke the retrieveFileContent method with the invalid file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario where an invalid file ID is provided. The expected result is an exception, which confirms that the method has robust error handling.

Scenario 3: Retrieve File Content with Null ID

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveFileContentWithNullId
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the retrieveFileContent method when provided with a null file ID. It ensures that the method handles this scenario correctly, likely by throwing an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a null file ID.
  Act: Invoke the retrieveFileContent method with the null file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario where a null file ID is provided. The expected result is an exception, which confirms that the method has robust error handling.
