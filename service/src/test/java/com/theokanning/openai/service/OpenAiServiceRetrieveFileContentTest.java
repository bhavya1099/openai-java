================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The method retrieveFileContent(String fileId) does not perform any form of authentication or authorization checks. If this method is exposed to an external interface, it could allow unauthorized access to sensitive file content.
Solution: Implement proper authentication and authorization checks before executing the function. This could be achieved using authentication frameworks or middleware, or by manually checking if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the action.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The function retrieveFileContent(String fileId) appears to accept a fileId as a parameter to retrieve a file. If not properly sanitized, it could be used to traverse directories and access unauthorized files.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize inputs to prevent path traversal attacks. Avoid using user-supplied input to form file paths. If it is necessary, use a white-list of allowed paths and filenames, and reject any input that does not match. Consider using a library or function that constructs file paths securely.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: If the ResponseBody from the execute() function opens a file or network connection, it may not be properly closed. This could lead to resource leaks, causing the application to consume more resources than necessary and potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
Solution: Ensure that all resources are properly closed after use. Java 7 introduced the try-with-resources statement for automatic resource management. Consider using this feature to automatically close resources after use.

"""
Scenario 1: Retrieve File Content with Valid File ID

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveFileContentWithValidFileId
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the retrieveFileContent method when provided with a valid file ID. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for the api and set up the execute method to return a valid ResponseBody. Provide a valid file ID as input.
  Act: Invoke the retrieveFileContent method with the valid file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the returned ResponseBody matches the expected result.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly retrieves file content when given a valid file ID. The expected result is based on the mock set up in the Arrange step. This test is significant in ensuring the method can successfully handle normal usage.

Scenario 2: Retrieve File Content with Invalid File ID

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveFileContentWithInvalidFileId
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the retrieveFileContent method when provided with an invalid file ID. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for the api and set up the execute method to throw an exception. Provide an invalid file ID as input.
  Act: Invoke the retrieveFileContent method with the invalid file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles an invalid file ID by throwing an exception. The expected result is based on the mock set up in the Arrange step. This test is significant in ensuring the method can properly handle error conditions.

Scenario 3: Retrieve File Content with Null File ID

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveFileContentWithNullFileId
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the retrieveFileContent method when provided with a null file ID. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for the api. Provide a null file ID as input.
  Act: Invoke the retrieveFileContent method with the null file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles a null file ID by throwing a NullPointerException. This test is significant in ensuring the method does not allow null inputs.

Scenario 4: Retrieve File Content when API is Unresponsive

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveFileContentWhenApiIsUnresponsive
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the retrieveFileContent method when the API is unresponsive. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for the api and set up the execute method to timeout or not respond. Provide a valid file ID as input.
  Act: Invoke the retrieveFileContent method with the valid file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that an appropriate exception (like a timeout exception) is thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles situations where the API is unresponsive by throwing an appropriate exception. This test is significant in ensuring the method can handle unexpected API behavior.
