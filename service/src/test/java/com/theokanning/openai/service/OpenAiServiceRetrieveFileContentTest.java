================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The method retrieveFileContent(String fileId) does not perform any authentication or authorization checks. This could allow unauthorized access to file content if the fileId is known or guessed.
Solution: Implement authentication and authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can access file content.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: If the fileId parameter of the retrieveFileContent(String fileId) method is used to construct a file path, it could be vulnerable to path traversal attacks, allowing access to files outside of the intended directory.
Solution: Sanitize the fileId parameter to prevent path traversal. One way to do this is by using the FilenameUtils from Apache Commons IO to get the base name of the file.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: The execute method could be vulnerable to resource exhaustion if it does not have adequate rate limiting or does not handle large files properly.
Solution: Implement rate limiting to prevent too many requests in a short period of time. When handling files, consider the file size and implement measures to handle large files appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-214: Information Exposure Through Process Environment
Issue: If any sensitive information such as API keys or database credentials are stored in environment variables, they could be exposed if an error stack trace reveals the process environment.
Solution: Avoid storing sensitive information in environment variables. If necessary, ensure that error handling does not reveal the process environment.

"""
Scenario 1: Retrieve File Content with Valid File ID

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveFileContentWithValidFileId
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the retrieveFileContent method when provided with a valid file ID. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for the api and set up the execute method to return a valid ResponseBody. Provide a valid file ID.
  Act: Invoke the retrieveFileContent method with the valid file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual returned ResponseBody against the expected ResponseBody.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the retrieveFileContent method correctly retrieves the content of the file when provided with a valid file ID. The expected result is the correct ResponseBody. This test is significant in ensuring the method can successfully handle valid file IDs.

Scenario 2: Retrieve File Content with Invalid File ID

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveFileContentWithInvalidFileId
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the retrieveFileContent method when provided with an invalid file ID. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for the api and set up the execute method to throw an exception. Provide an invalid file ID.
  Act: Invoke the retrieveFileContent method with the invalid file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the retrieveFileContent method correctly handles invalid file IDs by throwing an exception. The expected result is an exception. This test is significant in ensuring the method can successfully handle error cases.

Scenario 3: Retrieve File Content with Null File ID

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveFileContentWithNullFileId
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the retrieveFileContent method when provided with a null file ID. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for the api and set up the execute method to throw a NullPointerException. Provide a null file ID.
  Act: Invoke the retrieveFileContent method with the null file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the retrieveFileContent method correctly handles null file IDs by throwing a NullPointerException. The expected result is a NullPointerException. This test is significant in ensuring the method can successfully handle null inputs.
