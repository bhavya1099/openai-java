================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The function 'listModels()' is public and returns potentially sensitive data. If this function is called without proper access controls, it may lead to unintended information exposure.
Solution: Ensure that the function 'listModels()' is only accessible by authorized entities. Implement appropriate access control checks before the function execution.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The code does not seem to have any authentication or authorization checks before executing critical functions. This can allow unauthorized users to execute these functions.
Solution: Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access and execute critical functions.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The code uses 'ObjectMapper' from Jackson library, which can deserialize untrusted data. If the data is controlled by an attacker, it could lead to remote code execution.
Solution: Avoid deserializing untrusted data when possible. If deserialization is necessary, use safe deserialization techniques, such as using a whitelist of classes that can be deserialized or customizing the deserialization process to prevent deserialization of dangerous classes.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The code seems to use resources like 'ExecutorService' but does not appear to properly shut down these resources after use. This can lead to resource leaks.
Solution: Ensure that all resources are properly closed or released after use. Use 'finally' blocks or try-with-resources statements to guarantee resource release.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test to verify if the listModels() method returns all the available models

  Details:  
    TestName: testIfAllModelsAreReturned.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the listModels() method is returning all the available models in the system. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement is required as this method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the listModels() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the size of the returned list against the known number of models in the system.

  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the listModels() method is working correctly and returning all the models. The expected result is that the size of the list returned by the listModels() method will match the known number of models in the system. This test is significant to ensure that all models are being fetched correctly when the method is called.


  Scenario 2: Test to verify if the listModels() method returns an empty list when there are no models

  Details:  
    TestName: testIfEmptyListIsReturnedWhenNoModelsExist.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the listModels() method is returning an empty list when there are no models in the system. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure that there are no models in the system.
    Act: Invoke the listModels() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned list is empty.

  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the listModels() method is working correctly and returning an empty list when there are no models. The expected result is that the list returned by the listModels() method will be empty. This test is significant to ensure that the method is able to handle the scenario when there are no models in the system.


  Scenario 3: Test to verify if the listModels() method is handling exceptions properly

  Details:  
    TestName: testIfExceptionIsHandled.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the listModels() method is handling exceptions properly when there is an error while fetching the models. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the api.listModels() to throw an exception.
    Act: Invoke the listModels() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the appropriate exception is thrown.

  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the listModels() method is handling exceptions correctly. The expected result is that the method will throw the appropriate exception when there is an error while fetching the models. This test is significant to ensure that the method is able to handle any unexpected errors during execution.
