================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If user inputs are directly included into SQL queries without sanitization, it can lead to SQL Injection attacks where an attacker can manipulate the queries to gain unauthorized access or make unauthorized changes to the database.
Solution: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to ensure user inputs are correctly sanitized before they are included in SQL queries.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: If user inputs are directly included in the output HTML without sanitization, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting attacks where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, leading to session hijacking, identity theft, defacing the website, etc.
Solution: Use output encoding libraries to ensure user inputs are correctly sanitized before they are included in the output HTML.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, etc., should not be hardcoded in the code. If the code is exposed or leaked, this information can be misused.
Solution: Store sensitive information in environment variables or secure configuration files that are not included in the version control system.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: If the system resources are not properly managed, it can lead to resource exhaustion, leading to denial of service.
Solution: Implement rate limiting, input validation, etc., to ensure system resources are not exhausted.

"""
Scenario 1: Successful File Deletion

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulFileDeletion
  Description: This test is meant to check if the file deletion method works as expected when provided with a valid file ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid file ID to be used for the test.
  Act: Invoke the deleteFile method with the created file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned DeleteResult indicates a successful deletion.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly deletes the file when given a valid file ID. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity within the application.

Scenario 2: File Deletion with Nonexistent File ID

Details:  
  TestName: testFileDeletionWithNonexistentFileId
  Description: This test is designed to check how the method handles situations where it's provided with a file ID that doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a file ID that doesn't correspond to any file in the system.
  Act: Invoke the deleteFile method with the nonexistent file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned DeleteResult indicates a failure or an error.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method doesn't break when provided with a nonexistent file ID, and instead, it handles the situation gracefully. This is important for ensuring the robustness of the application.

Scenario 3: File Deletion with Null File ID

Details:  
  TestName: testFileDeletionWithNullFileId
  Description: This test aims to check how the method responds when called with a null file ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the file ID to null.
  Act: Invoke the deleteFile method with the null file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned DeleteResult indicates an error or if an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the method can handle null inputs without breaking, which is crucial for preventing potential null pointer exceptions in the application.
  
Scenario 4: File Deletion with Empty File ID

Details:  
  TestName: testFileDeletionWithEmptyFileId
  Description: This test is meant to ensure that the method can handle situations where it's provided with an empty string as the file ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the file ID to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the deleteFile method with the empty file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned DeleteResult indicates an error or if an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles an empty string input, which is important for maintaining the robustness of the application.
