================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If user inputs are not correctly sanitized, they can be used to manipulate SQL queries leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
Solution: Use prepared statements with parameterized queries or sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If the application is a web application and user inputs are not correctly sanitized, they can be used to inject malicious scripts.
Solution: Sanitize user inputs and apply appropriate output encoding when rendering user-controllable data.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: If the application does not properly control the allocation and release of system resources, it can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
Solution: Implement appropriate resource management, including timeouts and size limits.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: If the application does not properly validate file names, it could be manipulated to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.
Solution: Validate user inputs to ensure they do not traverse outside of the intended directory.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: If the deleteFile function doesn't check the user's privileges before executing, it can result in unauthorized file deletion.
Solution: Ensure that the deleteFile function is protected by appropriate authentication and authorization checks.

"""
Scenario 1: Successful File Deletion

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulFileDeletion
  Description: This test is meant to check if the file deletion method works as expected when provided with a valid file ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid file ID to be deleted and mock the deleteFile method to return a successful DeleteResult.
  Act: Invoke the deleteFile method with the valid file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the DeleteResult returned is as expected.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the deleteFile method works correctly when provided with a valid file ID. The expected result is a successful DeleteResult. This test is significant in ensuring that the application can successfully delete files.

Scenario 2: File Deletion with Non-existent File ID

Details: 
  TestName: testFileDeletionWithNonExistentFileId
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the deleteFile method when provided with a file ID that does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-existent file ID and mock the deleteFile method to return an error or exception.
  Act: Invoke the deleteFile method with the non-existent file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the expected error or exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the deleteFile method correctly handles the scenario where a non-existent file ID is provided. The expected result is an error or exception. This test is important in ensuring that the application can handle errors gracefully.

Scenario 3: File Deletion with Null File ID

Details: 
  TestName: testFileDeletionWithNullFileId
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the deleteFile method when provided with a null file ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null file ID and mock the deleteFile method to return an error or exception.
  Act: Invoke the deleteFile method with the null file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the expected error or exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the deleteFile method correctly handles the scenario where a null file ID is provided. The expected result is an error or exception. This test is important in ensuring that the application can handle null inputs correctly.
