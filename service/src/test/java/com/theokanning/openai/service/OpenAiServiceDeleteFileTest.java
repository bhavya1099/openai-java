================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: If the fileId parameter in the deleteFile method is not properly sanitized, it could lead to a path traversal attack, where an attacker could delete files outside of the intended directory.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate inputs. Do not allow file paths to be directly inputted by the user. Use a safe method for file deletion where the path is not user-controlled.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
Issue: If passwords are stored using a one-way hash without a salt, an attacker with access to the hash values can use precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to quickly find the original password.
Solution: Always use a salt when hashing passwords, and use a secure, slow hash algorithm specifically designed for password hashing, such as bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The deleteFile method does not seem to have any authentication or authorization checks. If this method is exposed to users without proper checks, they could delete any file.
Solution: Ensure that all methods, especially those performing critical functions like file deletion, have proper authentication and authorization checks in place.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: If the application does not properly limit the size or amount of resources that are requested or consumed, it could lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack.
Solution: Implement resource limiting controls to protect against resource exhaustion. This could involve limiting the size of files, the number of requests a user can make, etc.

"""
Scenario 1: Successful File Deletion

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulFileDeletion
  Description: This test is meant to check if the file deletion method works as expected when provided with a valid file ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid file ID to be used for the test.
  Act: Invoke the deleteFile method with the created file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned DeleteResult indicates a successful deletion.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method can successfully delete a file given a valid file ID. This is crucial as it is the expected behavior of the method.

Scenario 2: File Deletion with Non-Existent File ID

Details:  
  TestName: testFileDeletionWithNonExistentFileId
  Description: This test checks if the method handles the case where the provided file ID does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-existent file ID for the test.
  Act: Invoke the deleteFile method with the non-existent file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned DeleteResult indicates a failure or an error message.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method can handle cases where it is provided with a non-existent file ID. This is crucial in ensuring the robustness of the method.

Scenario 3: File Deletion with Null File ID

Details:  
  TestName: testFileDeletionWithNullFileId
  Description: This test checks if the method handles the case where the provided file ID is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the file ID to null for the test.
  Act: Invoke the deleteFile method with the null file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method throws an expected exception.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method can handle cases where it is provided with a null file ID. This is important in avoiding null pointer exceptions.

Scenario 4: File Deletion with Empty File ID

Details:  
  TestName: testFileDeletionWithEmptyFileId
  Description: This test checks if the method handles the case where the provided file ID is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the file ID to an empty string for the test.
  Act: Invoke the deleteFile method with the empty file ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method throws an expected exception or returns an error message.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method can handle cases where it is provided with an empty string as the file ID. This is important in ensuring the method's robustness.
