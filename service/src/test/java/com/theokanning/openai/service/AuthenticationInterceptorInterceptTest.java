================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Hardcoded Secrets (CWE-798)
Issue: The usage of hardcoded secrets in application code is a serious security risk. If the code is ever exposed or decompiled, the secret (in this case, the 'token') is immediately compromised.
Solution: Use a secure method of storing secrets, such as environment variables, or use a secure vault service. Avoid hardcoding secrets in the application code.

Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The 'token' is directly included in the header without any validation. This can lead to potential security risks if the token is manipulated or formatted incorrectly.
Solution: Always validate inputs before using them. Ensure that the 'token' is in the correct format before adding it to the header.

Vulnerability: Insecure Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)
Issue: The 'token' is being transmitted over a connection without any mention of encryption or secure transmission. If the connection is not secure, the token can be intercepted and compromised.
Solution: Ensure that the connection is secure (HTTPS) before transmitting sensitive information. Use libraries that support secure connections.

"""
Scenario 1: Valid Authorization Test

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithValidAuthorization
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful operation of the intercept method when provided with a valid authorization token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Chain object and a valid token.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock Chain object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned Response object with the expected Response.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the intercept method correctly adds the authorization header to the request and proceeds with the chain. The expected result is a successful Response object. This test is significant in ensuring the application can successfully handle authorized requests.

Scenario 2: Invalid Authorization Test

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithInvalidAuthorization
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the intercept method when provided with an invalid authorization token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Chain object and an invalid token.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock Chain object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an IOException due to invalid token.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the intercept method correctly throws an exception when the authorization token is invalid. This test is significant in ensuring the application correctly handles unauthorized requests.

Scenario 3: Null Authorization Test

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithNullAuthorization
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the intercept method when provided with a null token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Chain object and a null token.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock Chain object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the intercept method correctly throws a NullPointerException when the token is null. This test is significant in ensuring the application correctly handles null tokens.

Scenario 4: Empty Authorization Test

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithEmptyAuthorization
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the intercept method when provided with an empty token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Chain object and an empty token.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock Chain object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an IOException due to empty token.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the intercept method correctly throws an exception when the token is empty. This test is significant in ensuring the application correctly handles empty tokens.
