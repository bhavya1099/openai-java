================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Hardcoded Secrets (CWE-798)
Issue: The usage of a hardcoded token in the 'Authorization' header. This can lead to token leakage and unauthorized access if the code is exposed or the binary is decompiled.
Solution: Avoid hardcoding secrets in your source code. Use secure environment variables or secure vault services to handle secrets.

Vulnerability: Insecure Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)
Issue: If the token is sent over an unencrypted connection, it can be intercepted by an attacker. This can lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure that the connection is encrypted using HTTPS or a similar secure protocol when sending sensitive information.

Vulnerability: Missing Exception Handling (CWE-390)
Issue: The function throws an IOException but it is not handled. This can lead to unexpected application behavior or reveal sensitive information about the application.
Solution: Add appropriate exception handling to manage IOExceptions and avoid potential system crashes or information leakage.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Valid Authorization Test

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithValidAuthorization
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful operation of the intercept method when provided with a valid authorization token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Chain object and a valid token.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock Chain object.
  Assert: Verify if the Response object returned is not null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that a valid Response object is returned when a valid token is provided. This is significant as it confirms that the method works correctly with valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Invalid Authorization Test

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithInvalidAuthorization
  Description: This test is meant to check the operation of the intercept method when provided with an invalid authorization token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Chain object and an invalid token.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock Chain object.
  Assert: Verify if the Response object returned is null or an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method handles invalid tokens correctly, either by returning null or throwing an exception. This is important for error handling and ensuring secure operation of the application.

Scenario 3: Null Authorization Test

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithNullAuthorization
  Description: This test is meant to check the operation of the intercept method when provided with a null token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Chain object and a null token.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock Chain object.
  Assert: Verify if an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method handles null tokens correctly by throwing an exception. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the application.

Scenario 4: Empty Authorization Test

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithEmptyAuthorization
  Description: This test is meant to check the operation of the intercept method when provided with an empty token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Chain object and an empty token.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock Chain object.
  Assert: Verify if an exception is thrown or a null Response is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method handles empty tokens correctly, either by returning null or throwing an exception. This is vital for error handling and ensuring secure operation of the application.

Scenario 5: Test with Null Chain Object

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithNullChain
  Description: This test is meant to check the operation of the intercept method when provided with a null Chain object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null Chain object and a valid token.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the null Chain object.
  Assert: Verify if an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles null Chain objects by throwing an exception. This is crucial for robust error handling in the application.
