================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Hardcoded Secrets (CWE-798)
Issue: The usage of hardcoded secrets in application code is a serious security risk. If the code is ever exposed or accessible, this could lead to unauthorized access of your systems.
Solution: Avoid hardcoding secrets in your code. Use secure environment variables to store your secrets.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (CWE-639)
Issue: The token is directly used in the request header. If an attacker can guess or brute-force this token, they could potentially access other resources.
Solution: Use a secure random session identifier that is not easily guessable or brute-forceable. Implement access controls checks to verify the user is authorized to access the requested resource.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (CWE-778)
Issue: There is no logging of the request or its outcome. If an unauthorized access attempt or other suspicious activity occurs, it would not be recorded.
Solution: Implement logging and monitoring of all requests and their outcomes. This can help in identifying suspicious activities and in forensic investigation if a breach occurs.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling (CWE-755)
Issue: The code does not have any error handling. If an error occurs during the execution of the request, it could cause the application to crash or expose sensitive information.
Solution: Implement proper error handling. Catch exceptions and handle them accordingly. Never expose detailed error messages to the user, as they could reveal sensitive information or implementation details.

"""
Scenario 1: Valid Authorization Test

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithValidAuthorization
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful operation of the intercept method when a valid token is used for authorization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock chain and a valid token.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock chain.
  Assert: Compare the returned response with the expected response.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the intercept method returns the expected response when a valid token is used. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Invalid Authorization Test

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithInvalidAuthorization
  Description: This test is meant to check the operation of the intercept method when an invalid token is used for authorization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock chain and an invalid token.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock chain.
  Assert: Expect an IOException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the intercept method throws an IOException when an invalid token is used. This test is important as it checks the error handling of the method.

Scenario 3: Null Token Test

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithNullToken
  Description: This test is meant to check the operation of the intercept method when the token is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock chain and set the token to null.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock chain.
  Assert: Expect an IOException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the intercept method throws an IOException when the token is null. This test is important as it checks the error handling of the method when dealing with null values.

Scenario 4: Empty Token Test

Details:  
  TestName: testInterceptWithEmptyToken
  Description: This test is meant to check the operation of the intercept method when the token is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock chain and set the token to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock chain.
  Assert: Expect an IOException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the intercept method throws an IOException when the token is an empty string. This test is important as it checks the error handling of the method when dealing with empty strings.
