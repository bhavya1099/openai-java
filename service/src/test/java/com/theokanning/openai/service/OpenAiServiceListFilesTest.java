================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If the application interacts with a database using SQL queries, and if these queries are constructed by concatenating user inputs, it can lead to SQL Injection attacks. An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to access, modify or delete data in the database.
Solution: Use Prepared Statements or Parameterized queries. These methods automatically sanitize the inputs and prevent SQL Injection attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If the application is a web application and it directly uses user inputs to generate web pages, it can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker can inject malicious scripts which can be executed on the victim's browser.
Solution: Always sanitize user inputs before using them to generate web pages. Use functions that can encode special characters.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: If the application does not properly manage the system resources it uses, it can consume all available resources and cause the system to slow down or crash.
Solution: Implement proper resource management policies. This includes releasing resources after they have been used and implementing limits on the amount of resources that can be used.

Scenario 1: Test to verify the successful listing of files

Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulFileListing.
    Description: This test is meant to check the successful retrieval of a list of files. The target scenario is when the listFiles method is called without any issues.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the api.listFiles() method to return a successful response with a list of files.
    Act: Invoke the listFiles method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected list of files.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the listFiles method returns the correct list of files when the API call is successful. The expected result is the list of files returned by the mocked API call. This test is significant as it ensures the basic functionality of the listFiles method is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the behavior when no files are present

Details:  
    TestName: testFileListingWhenNoFilesPresent.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the listFiles method when no files are present. The target scenario is when the listFiles method is called but there are no files to return.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the api.listFiles() method to return a successful response but with an empty list.
    Act: Invoke the listFiles method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list is empty.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the listFiles method correctly handles the scenario where no files are present. The expected result is an empty list. This test is significant as it checks the method's handling of edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the behavior when the API call fails

Details:  
    TestName: testFileListingWhenApiCallFails.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the listFiles method when the API call fails. The target scenario is when the listFiles method is called but the API call throws an exception.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the api.listFiles() method to throw an exception.
    Act: Invoke the listFiles method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the appropriate exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the listFiles method correctly handles the scenario where the API call fails. The expected result is the thrown exception. This test is significant as it ensures the method's error handling is functioning correctly.
