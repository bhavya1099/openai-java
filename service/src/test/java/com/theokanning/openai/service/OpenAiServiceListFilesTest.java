================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure API
Issue: The API endpoints used in the application might not be secure, leading to potential data leaks or unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure that all API endpoints used are secure and implement proper authentication and authorization checks.

Vulnerability: Insecure Dependencies
Issue: The application uses external libraries that might contain vulnerabilities which can be exploited.
Solution: Keep all dependencies up to date and use a security scanner to check for known vulnerabilities in the dependencies.

Vulnerability: Insecure Data Processing
Issue: There might be insecure data processing in the application which could lead to data corruption or data leaks.
Solution: Ensure all data processing is done securely, following best practices. Validate and sanitize all input data and encode or encrypt output data when necessary.

Vulnerability: Unmanaged Resources
Issue: Resources like database connections or file handles might not be managed properly, leading to potential resource leaks.
Solution: Use try-with-resources or similar constructs to ensure resources are properly closed after use.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the successful listing of files

Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulFileListing.
    Description: This test is meant to check the successful retrieval of all the files present. The target scenario is when the listFiles method is called without any issues.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the api.listFiles() method to return a successful response with a list of files.
    Act: Invoke the listFiles method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected list of files.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the listFiles method returns the correct list of files when the API call is successful. The expected result is the list of files returned by the mock API call. This test is significant as it ensures the basic functionality of the listFiles method.

Scenario 2: Test to verify behavior when no files are present

Details:  
    TestName: testFileListingWhenNoFilesPresent.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the listFiles method when there are no files. The target scenario is when the listFiles method is called and there are no files.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the api.listFiles() method to return a successful response with an empty list.
    Act: Invoke the listFiles method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned list is empty.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the listFiles method returns an empty list when there are no files. The expected result is an empty list. This test is significant as it checks the method's handling of a scenario where no files are present.

Scenario 3: Test to verify behavior when API call fails

Details:  
    TestName: testFileListingWhenApiCallFails.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the listFiles method when the API call fails. The target scenario is when the listFiles method is called and the API call fails.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the api.listFiles() method to throw an exception.
    Act: Invoke the listFiles method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that an exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the listFiles method throws an exception when the API call fails. The expected result is an exception. This test is significant as it checks the method's error handling.
