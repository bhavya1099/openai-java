Test generated by RoostGPT for test java-junit4-test using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

The provided code snippet does not contain any business logic to be tested. It only contains imports and a basic constructor for the `OpenAiService` class. However, based on the code provided, here are some general test scenarios that could be written when further methods and logic are implemented in this class:

1. Test if the `OpenAiService` is properly initialized when a valid `OpenAiApi` object is provided.
2. Test if the `OpenAiService` throws an appropriate exception when a null `OpenAiApi` object is provided.
3. Test if the `executorService` is null after the `OpenAiService` is initialized.
4. Test if the `OpenAiService` uses the provided `OpenAiApi` object for subsequent method calls.
5. Test if the `OpenAiService` can handle different types of `OpenAiApi` objects with varying configurations.
6. Test if the `OpenAiService` can properly clean up resources (like closing connections) when it's no longer in use.
7. Test if the `OpenAiService` can handle concurrent requests and operations correctly.

Please note that these are hypothetical scenarios and might not apply exactly to your situation. The actual test scenarios would depend on the rest of the `OpenAiService` class implementation.
