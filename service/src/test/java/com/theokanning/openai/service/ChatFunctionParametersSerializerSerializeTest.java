================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The RuntimeException thrown in the catch block exposes the details of the exception to the users, which might leak sensitive information about the system or the application. This can be exploited by attackers to gain knowledge about the internal workings of the system.
Solution: Avoid throwing generic RuntimeExceptions and exposing details of the exception. Instead, log the exception details for debugging and throw a custom exception without sensitive details.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The serialize method is declared as public, which means it can be accessed from anywhere. This can lead to potential misuse of the method, as it is exposed to all classes, packages, and subclasses.
Solution: Limit the accessibility of the method by changing its access modifier to private or protected, as per the requirement. If the method needs to be accessed from outside the class, provide a public method to access it in a controlled way.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The JsonGenerator object 'gen' is not properly closed in a finally block. This can lead to resource leaks which can degrade system performance over time.
Solution: Ensure that all resources are properly closed after use. Use try-with-resources or a finally block to close the JsonGenerator object.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing when the Class value is Null
  Details:  
    TestName: testSerializeWhenValueIsNull
    Description: This test checks if the serialize method is able to handle null values and write null as expected. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a null value for the Class value.
    Act: Invoke the serialize method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the JsonGenerator writes null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the serialize method can handle null values. The expected result is that the JsonGenerator writes null because the Class value is null.

Scenario 2: Successful JSON Schema Generation
  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulJsonSchemaGeneration
    Description: This test verifies that the serialize method can successfully generate a JSON schema when given a valid Class value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a valid Class value.
    Act: Invoke the serialize method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the JsonNode schema is written.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the serialize method is able to generate a JSON schema when given a valid Class value. The expected result is that the JsonNode schema is written.

Scenario 3: Exception during JSON Schema Generation
  Details:  
    TestName: testExceptionDuringJsonSchemaGeneration
    Description: This test checks if the serialize method can handle exceptions during JSON schema generation and throws a RuntimeException as expected. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a Class value that will cause an exception during JSON schema generation.
    Act: Invoke the serialize method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that a RuntimeException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the serialize method can handle exceptions during JSON schema generation and throws a RuntimeException as expected. The significance of this test is to ensure that the application is able to handle and report errors during JSON schema generation.
