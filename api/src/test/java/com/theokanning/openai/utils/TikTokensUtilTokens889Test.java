================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: If an attacker can inject data into the system that ends up in logs, they may be able to forge log entries or inject malicious content into logs.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate data before logging. Consider using a safe logging library that automatically encodes data.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function tokens() does not perform any validation on its input arguments. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the function is called with invalid or malicious data.
Solution: Always validate input data for length, format, and business rules before processing. Use Java's built-in features for data validation, such as the java.util.regex package for regex-based validation.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: If the application uses predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the values and exploit this.
Solution: Always use a secure source of randomness when randomness is needed. Java provides java.security.SecureRandom for this purpose.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The function tokens() processes and returns potentially sensitive data (messages and names). If this data is not handled securely, it could lead to exposure of private information.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is always encrypted when stored and transmitted, and that it is not logged or output in error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: If an error occurs during the execution of the tokens() function, the error message may expose sensitive information.
Solution: Configure error handling to prevent exposure of sensitive information in error messages, such as system details or debug information. Consider using a custom error page or message that provides an error code and contact information, but no sensitive details.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with valid modelName "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301" and non-empty messages list

Details:  
    TestName: testTokensWithGptThreePointFiveTurboAndNonEmptyMessages.
    Description: This test case is designed to verify the tokens() method for the scenario where the modelName is "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301" and the messages list contains valid ChatMessage objects. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a list of ChatMessage objects. Set the modelName as "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301".
    Act: Invoke the tokens() method with the modelName and the list of messages.
    Assert: Verify that the returned token count is as expected.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the tokens() method correctly counts the tokens when the modelName is "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301" and the messages list is non-empty. This is crucial for ensuring that the tokenization process is working correctly for this model type.

Scenario 2: Test with valid modelName "gpt-4" and non-empty messages list

Details:  
    TestName: testTokensWithGptFourAndNonEmptyMessages.
    Description: This test case is designed to verify the tokens() method for the scenario where the modelName is "gpt-4" and the messages list contains valid ChatMessage objects. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a list of ChatMessage objects. Set the modelName as "gpt-4".
    Act: Invoke the tokens() method with the modelName and the list of messages.
    Assert: Verify that the returned token count is as expected.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the tokens() method correctly counts the tokens when the modelName is "gpt-4" and the messages list is non-empty. This is crucial for ensuring that the tokenization process is working correctly for this model type.

Scenario 3: Test with invalid modelName and non-empty messages list

Details:  
    TestName: testTokensWithInvalidModelNameAndNonEmptyMessages.
    Description: This test case is designed to verify the tokens() method for the scenario where the modelName is not recognized and the messages list contains valid ChatMessage objects. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a list of ChatMessage objects. Set the modelName as an unrecognized string.
    Act: Invoke the tokens() method with the modelName and the list of messages.
    Assert: Verify that the returned token count is as expected.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the tokens() method handles unrecognized modelNames correctly. This is important for ensuring the robustness of the method.

Scenario 4: Test with valid modelName and empty messages list

Details:  
    TestName: testTokensWithValidModelNameAndEmptyMessages.
    Description: This test case is designed to verify the tokens() method for the scenario where the modelName is valid and the messages list is empty. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty list of ChatMessage objects. Set the modelName as a valid model name.
    Act: Invoke the tokens() method with the modelName and the empty list of messages.
    Assert: Verify that the returned token count is as expected.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the tokens() method handles an empty messages list correctly. This is important for ensuring that the method can handle all possible input scenarios.
