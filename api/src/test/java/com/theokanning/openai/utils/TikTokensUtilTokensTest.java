================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If the application constructs SQL statements based on user input, there's a risk that an attacker could manipulate the statements by injecting malicious SQL code.
Solution: Use PreparedStatement or similar features in Java to avoid SQL injection attacks. Never construct SQL queries using string concatenation of raw user input.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If the application inserts user-controlled data into a web page without proper sanitization, it could be manipulated into executing arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's session.
Solution: Always sanitize user input before inserting it into a web page. Use context-specific encoding when modifying the browser document on the client side. For Java, use appropriate libraries to sanitize inputs and escape special characters.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: If the application exposes sensitive information in error messages or logs, it could give an attacker valuable information about the internal workings of the application.
Solution: Configure your logging properly to avoid logging sensitive information. Catch and handle exceptions to avoid exposing stack traces or other sensitive information in error messages.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Valid Encoding and Non-Empty Text
Details:
  TestName: testValidEncodingAndNonEmptyText
  Description: This test is meant to check the token count when the provided encoding is valid and the text is non-empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid encoding and a non-empty text string.
  Act: Invoke the tokens method with the valid encoding and non-empty text.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual token count against the expected token count.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns the correct token count for the provided encoding and text. This test is significant to ensure that the method can correctly process non-empty text with a valid encoding.

Scenario 2: Test for Valid Encoding and Empty Text
Details:
  TestName: testValidEncodingAndEmptyText
  Description: This test is meant to check the token count when the provided encoding is valid and the text is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid encoding and an empty text string.
  Act: Invoke the tokens method with the valid encoding and empty text.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual token count against the expected token count (should be zero).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns zero for an empty text string, regardless of the encoding. This test is significant to ensure that the method can correctly handle empty text.

Scenario 3: Test for Null Encoding
Details:
  TestName: testNullEncoding
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when the provided encoding is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a null encoding and a non-empty text string.
  Act: Invoke the tokens method with the null encoding and non-empty text.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method throws an exception when the encoding is null. This test is significant to ensure that the method can correctly handle null encodings.

Scenario 4: Test for Null Text
Details:
  TestName: testNullText
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when the provided text is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid encoding and a null text string.
  Act: Invoke the tokens method with the valid encoding and null text.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method throws an exception when the text is null. This test is significant to ensure that the method can correctly handle null text.

Scenario 5: Test for Unsupported Encoding
Details:
  TestName: testUnsupportedEncoding
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when the provided encoding is not supported.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an unsupported encoding and a non-empty text string.
  Act: Invoke the tokens method with the unsupported encoding and non-empty text.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method throws an exception when the encoding is not supported. This test is significant to ensure that the method can correctly handle unsupported encodings.
