================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The function getEncoding(modelName) may return null, which is not properly handled before using it to call the encode method. This could lead to a Null Pointer Exception, causing the program to crash.
Solution: Add a null check after calling the getEncoding(modelName) method. If the result is null, return an empty list or handle the error appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
Issue: The function encode(String modelName, String text) doesn't check the size of the input text before encoding. If the input is too large, it could cause a buffer overflow, leading to potential memory corruption and unexpected program behavior.
Solution: Add a check for the size of the input text before encoding. If the size exceeds the maximum buffer size, return an error or handle the situation appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function isBlank(text) checks if the text is blank, but it doesn't validate the content of the text. If the text contains malicious characters or sequences, it could lead to security vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection.
Solution: Perform proper input validation on the text before processing. Remove or escape any potentially harmful characters or sequences. Consider using a trusted library or framework that automatically handles these types of input sanitization.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the encode method with blank text

Details:  
  TestName: encodeWithBlankText
  Description: This test is meant to check if the encode method handles blank text input correctly. The expected behavior is that it should return an empty list. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No data setup is required for this test as the input is blank text. 
  Act: Invoke the encode method with a valid model name and blank text.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles blank text input. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method can gracefully handle situations where the input text is blank without causing unexpected errors or exceptions.

Scenario 2: Testing the encode method with null encoding

Details:  
  TestName: encodeWithNullEncoding
  Description: This test is meant to check if the encode method handles scenarios where the encoding is null correctly. The expected behavior is that it should return an empty list. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the getEncoding method to return null when invoked with the provided model name.
  Act: Invoke the encode method with a valid model name and non-blank text.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles scenarios where the encoding is null. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method can handle situations where the encoding could not be retrieved for the provided model name without causing unexpected errors or exceptions.

Scenario 3: Testing the encode method with valid input

Details:  
  TestName: encodeWithValidInput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the encode method returns the correct encoded list when provided with valid input. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the getEncoding method to return a valid Encoding object. Also, mock the encode method of the Encoding object to return a specific encoded list.
  Act: Invoke the encode method with a valid model name and non-blank text.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list matches the specific encoded list.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly encodes the text using the provided model name. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method is functioning as expected when provided with valid input. 

Scenario 4: Testing the encode method with a non-existent model name

Details:  
  TestName: encodeWithNonExistentModelName
  Description: This test is meant to check if the encode method handles scenarios where the provided model name does not exist. The expected behavior is that it should return an empty list. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the getEncoding method to return null when invoked with the non-existent model name.
  Act: Invoke the encode method with a non-existent model name and non-blank text.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles scenarios where the provided model name does not exist. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method can handle such situations without causing unexpected errors or exceptions.
