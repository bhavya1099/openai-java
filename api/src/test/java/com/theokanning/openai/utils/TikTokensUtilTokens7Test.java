================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The submitted code does not contain any debug code, however, it's a common mistake to leave debug code in production that might expose sensitive information.
Solution: Always ensure to remove debug code or make use of logging levels to hide debug information in a production environment.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The code does not seem to expose any private information directly. However, if the text passed to the 'tokens' method contains sensitive information, it can be a potential risk.
Solution: Ensure that the text passed to the 'tokens' method does not contain any sensitive information. If it does, use proper encryption/decryption methods to secure it.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: While the submitted code does not directly expose information, the output of the 'tokens' method could potentially be used to gather information about the internal state of the application.
Solution: Consider if the output of the 'tokens' method should be restricted or obfuscated in any way to prevent potential information exposure.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The 'tokens' method does not perform any authentication or authorization checks, which could be a problem if it is a critical function.
Solution: If the 'tokens' method is a critical function, ensure that proper authentication and authorization checks are performed before it is executed.

Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: If any of the imported libraries are downloaded from an untrusted source without an integrity check, it could lead to potential security risks.
Solution: Always download libraries from trusted sources and perform an integrity check to ensure the library has not been modified.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when both inputs are valid
  Details: 
    TestName: testValidInputs
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the tokens method when both the modelName and text inputs are valid.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid modelName and a valid text string.
    Act: Invoke the tokens method with the created modelName and text.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the tokens method returns the correct number of tokens when both inputs are valid. This is important as it ensures the correct functionality of the tokens method.

Scenario 2: Test when modelName is null
  Details: 
    TestName: testNullModelName
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the tokens method when the modelName input is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null modelName and a valid text string.
    Act: Invoke the tokens method with the null modelName and text.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the tokens method handles null inputs correctly. This is crucial for preventing unexpected behavior or crashes in the application.

Scenario 3: Test when text is null
  Details: 
    TestName: testNullText
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the tokens method when the text input is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid modelName and a null text string.
    Act: Invoke the tokens method with the created modelName and null text.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the tokens method handles null inputs correctly. This is crucial for preventing unexpected behavior or crashes in the application.

Scenario 4: Test when both inputs are null
  Details: 
    TestName: testBothInputsNull
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the tokens method when both the modelName and text inputs are null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null modelName and a null text string.
    Act: Invoke the tokens method with the null modelName and null text.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the tokens method handles null inputs correctly. This is crucial for preventing unexpected behavior or crashes in the application.

Scenario 5: Test when text is an empty string
  Details: 
    TestName: testEmptyText
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the tokens method when the text input is an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid modelName and an empty text string.
    Act: Invoke the tokens method with the created modelName and empty text.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the tokens method handles empty strings correctly. This is crucial for ensuring that the method can handle a variety of inputs and still function correctly.
