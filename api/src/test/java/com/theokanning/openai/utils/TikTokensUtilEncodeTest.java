================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: The function 'encode' allows for any string to be encoded. If the string is user input, it may lead to injection attacks.
Solution: Sanitize and validate any user input before it is processed. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Also, consider using a security library to handle input validation and sanitization.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The function 'encode' is public and static, which means it can be accessed from anywhere in the application. This could potentially expose sensitive information or provide an attack vector.
Solution: Limit the visibility of methods and functions to the minimal required. If the function does not need to be accessed from outside the class, consider making it private or protected.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: Java's built-in random number generator is not suitable for generating cryptographic keys or other security-critical values. If used in a security context, it may lead to predictable values and compromise the security of the application.
Solution: Use a secure random number generator such as 'java.security.SecureRandom' for generating security-critical random values.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Encoding 
Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulEncoding
  Description: This test will verify if the method can successfully encode a given string when a valid encoding and string are provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid Encoding object and a non-blank string. 
    Act: Call the encode method with these parameters.
    Assert: Check if the returned list is not empty and if it corresponds to the expected encoding.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the method can successfully encode the provided string. This is important as it verifies the core functionality of the method. 

Scenario 2: Blank String Encoding 
Details:  
  TestName: testBlankStringEncoding
  Description: This test will check how the method handles a blank string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid Encoding object and a blank string. 
    Act: Call the encode method with these parameters.
    Assert: Check if the returned list is empty.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles blank strings by returning an empty list. This is important to ensure that the method doesn't crash or behave unexpectedly when a blank string is provided.

Scenario 3: Null String Encoding 
Details:  
  TestName: testNullStringEncoding
  Description: This test will check how the method handles a null string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid Encoding object and a null string. 
    Act: Call the encode method with these parameters.
    Assert: Check if the returned list is empty.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles null strings by returning an empty list. This is important to ensure that the method doesn't crash or behave unexpectedly when a null string is provided.

Scenario 4: Null Encoding 
Details:  
  TestName: testNullEncoding
  Description: This test will check how the method handles a null encoding.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null Encoding object and a valid string. 
    Act: Call the encode method with these parameters.
    Assert: An exception should be thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles null encoding by throwing an exception. This is important to ensure that the method doesn't crash or behave unexpectedly when a null encoding is provided.
