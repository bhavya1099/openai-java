================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: If the 'ChatFunctionProperty' object contains file data, uploading files without proper validation can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service if a malicious file is uploaded.
Solution: Ensure to validate and sanitize the 'ChatFunctionProperty' object, especially if it contains file data. Limit the file types that can be uploaded and scan for viruses or malicious content.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'addProperty' method does not perform any validation on the 'property' input. This can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the input is not what the method expects.
Solution: Perform input validation on 'property' before using it. Ensure it is non-null, of the correct type, and within expected boundaries.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the 'ChatFunctionProperty' object contains sensitive data, it should not be exposed without proper access control checks.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data in 'ChatFunctionProperty' is properly encrypted and that appropriate access controls are in place before it is exposed.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if a property is added successfully
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testPropertyAddition
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method successfully adds a property to the parameters. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock ChatFunctionProperty object.
    Act: Invoke the addProperty method with the mock property.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the property has been added to the parameters.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method is adding properties as expected. This is crucial for the correct functioning of the chat functionality.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if multiple properties are added successfully
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testMultiplePropertyAddition
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method successfully adds multiple properties to the parameters. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create multiple mock ChatFunctionProperty objects.
    Act: Invoke the addProperty method multiple times with the mock properties.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if all the properties have been added to the parameters.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method is adding multiple properties as expected. This is crucial for the correct functioning of the chat functionality and for ensuring multiple properties can be handled.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if null property is handled
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testNullPropertyHandling
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method handles null properties appropriately without throwing unexpected exceptions. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not create a ChatFunctionProperty object, instead pass null.
    Act: Invoke the addProperty method with null.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the method handles null properties without breaking.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method is robust enough to handle null properties. This is crucial for ensuring the stability of the chat functionality.

  Scenario 4: Test to check if property addition returns Builder instance
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testBuilderInstanceReturn
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns the Builder instance after adding a property. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock ChatFunctionProperty object.
    Act: Invoke the addProperty method with the mock property.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the method returns a Builder instance.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method is following the Builder pattern correctly by returning a Builder instance. This is important for maintaining consistency in coding style and ensuring the Builder pattern is implemented correctly.
