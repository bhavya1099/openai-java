================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: If user-supplied data is not properly validated, it can lead to security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.
Solution: Always validate user-supplied data using a whitelist of acceptable inputs. Also, consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: Hard-coded credentials can lead to unauthorized access if the source code is ever exposed.
Solution: Never hard-code credentials in your code. Instead, consider using environment variables or secure configuration files to store sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: Leaving debug code or methods in an application can expose system internals, sensitive information, or functionality that is useful to an attacker.
Solution: Always remove debug code or methods before deploying an application. Consider using a static code analysis tool to detect leftover debug code.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: If a method in your application doesn't perform any authentication before performing a critical function, it could be exploited to perform unauthorized actions.
Solution: Always authenticate and authorize before performing critical functions. Consider using a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage permissions.

"""
Scenario 1: Description Is Set Successfully

Details:  
  TestName: setDescriptionSuccessfully.
  Description: This test aims to check whether the description is set successfully when a valid description is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Builder instance and a valid description string.
  Act: Invoke the description method with the created description string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the description of the Builder instance is set to the provided description.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the description method correctly sets the description of the Builder instance when a valid description is provided. This is important to ensure that the Builder instance can correctly store and retrieve the description.

Scenario 2: Description Is Not Set When Null Is Provided

Details:  
  TestName: descriptionNotSetWhenNull.
  Description: This test aims to check if the description is not set when null is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Builder instance.
  Act: Invoke the description method with null.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the description of the Builder instance is still null.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the description method does not set the description of the Builder instance when null is provided. This is important to prevent null pointer exceptions in further operations with the description.

Scenario 3: Description Is Not Set When Empty String Is Provided

Details:  
  TestName: descriptionNotSetWhenEmptyString.
  Description: This test aims to check if the description is not set when an empty string is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Builder instance.
  Act: Invoke the description method with an empty string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the description of the Builder instance is still null or not set to empty string.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the description method does not set the description of the Builder instance when an empty string is provided. This is important to ensure that the description does not become meaningless.

Scenario 4: Description Method Returns Same Builder Instance

Details:  
  TestName: descriptionMethodReturnsSameInstance.
  Description: This test aims to check if the description method returns the same Builder instance on which it was called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Builder instance.
  Act: Invoke the description method with a valid description string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Builder instance is the same as the one on which the method was called.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the description method returns the same Builder instance on which it was called, ensuring the ability to chain method calls on the Builder instance.
