================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The method addProperty adds properties to a map using the property name as the key. If the property names are predictable and can be manipulated by the user, it could lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure that the property names are not predictable or user-controlled. Implement proper access controls checks before adding properties to the map.

Vulnerability: Null Pointer Dereference or CWE-476
Issue: The 'required' field is checked for null and then a new ArrayList is created if it is null. If multiple threads call this method at the same time, a race condition could occur causing null pointer exceptions.
Solution: Initialize the 'required' field where it is declared or in the constructor of the class to avoid null checks later in the code.

Vulnerability: Improper Control of Generation of Code (aka 'Code Injection') or CWE-94
Issue: If the property names or values are user-controlled and used in dynamic code execution, it could lead to code injection attacks.
Solution: Ensure that the property names and values are not user-controlled or properly sanitize and validate the inputs before using them.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to add a non-required property to the properties map

TestName: addNonRequiredProperty
Description: This test is meant to check if a non-required property can be added to the properties map. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a ChatFunctionProperty with the required attribute set to false.
  Act: Invoke the addProperty method with the created property.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the property has been added to the properties map but not in the required list.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that non-required properties are only added to the properties map and not the required list. This is significant to ensure that only required properties are added to the required list.

Scenario 2: Test to add a required property to the properties map and the required list

TestName: addRequiredProperty
Description: This test is meant to check if a required property can be added to both the properties map and the required list. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a ChatFunctionProperty with the required attribute set to true.
  Act: Invoke the addProperty method with the created property.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the property has been added to both the properties map and the required list.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that required properties are added to both the properties map and the required list. This is significant to maintain the integrity of required properties.

Scenario 3: Test to handle null properties

TestName: handleNullProperty
Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles null properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the property to null.
  Act: Invoke the addProperty method with the null property.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if no changes were made to the properties map and the required list.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that null properties do not affect the properties map and the required list. This is significant to prevent NullPointerExceptions and maintain data integrity.

Scenario 4: Test to handle properties with null names

TestName: handleNullNameProperty
Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles properties with null names.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a ChatFunctionProperty with the name attribute set to null.
  Act: Invoke the addProperty method with the created property.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if no changes were made to the properties map and the required list.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that properties with null names do not affect the properties map and the required list. This is significant to prevent NullPointerExceptions and maintain data integrity.

Scenario 5: Test to handle properties with empty names

TestName: handleEmptyNameProperty
Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles properties with empty names.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a ChatFunctionProperty with the name attribute set to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the addProperty method with the created property.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if no changes were made to the properties map and the required list.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that properties with empty names do not affect the properties map and the required list. This is significant to prevent adding properties with invalid names.
