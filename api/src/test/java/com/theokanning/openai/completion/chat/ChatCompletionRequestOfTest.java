================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Import Statement Syntax
Issue: The code contains multiple import statements separated by commas, which is not a valid syntax in Java. This can lead to compilation errors, preventing the application from running and potentially hiding other issues in early stages of development.
Solution: Correct the import statements to ensure each is on a separate line with no trailing commas. For example, use 'import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;' on one line and 'import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;' on the next line.

Vulnerability: Missing Class Definition
Issue: The method 'ChatCompletionRequestFunctionCall of(String name)' is defined without a surrounding class structure, which will cause a compilation error. This prevents the application from being compiled and run, masking possible runtime security issues.
Solution: Encapsulate the method within a properly defined class. For example, define a class named 'ChatCompletionRequestFunctionCall' and include the method within this class.

Vulnerability: Excessive Imports
Issue: The code includes multiple imports from 'lombok' that may not be necessary if the annotations are not used within the class. Unnecessary imports can clutter the codebase, increase compilation time, and potentially introduce unused dependencies which might have vulnerabilities.
Solution: Review and remove any unused imports. Ensure that only necessary libraries are included to minimize the attack surface and reduce the potential for including libraries with known vulnerabilities.

================================================================================
``` 
Scenario 1: Valid Name Input

Details:
  TestName: testValidNameInput
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly creates an instance of ChatCompletionRequestFunctionCall when provided with a valid name string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a valid string input, e.g., "JohnDoe".
  Act: Invoke the of method with the prepared string.
  Assert: Assert that the returned object is not null and that the name attribute of the returned object matches the input string.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method initializes the object with the correct name and that the object creation was successful. This test is significant to ensure that the method handles standard input correctly and sets the object's properties as expected.

Scenario 2: Null Name Input

Details:
  TestName: testNullNameInput
  Description: This test checks how the method handles a null input for the name parameter, expecting it to throw a specific type of exception or handle the null appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the name input to null.
  Act: Invoke the of method with the null input.
  Assert: Assert that the method throws a NullPointerException.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when provided with null input, which is important for preventing the creation of invalid objects in the application, thereby maintaining data integrity and error handling.

Scenario 3: Empty String Name Input

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyStringNameInput
  Description: This test examines the behavior of the method when an empty string is passed as the name parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an empty string "" as the input.
  Act: Invoke the of method with the empty string.
  Assert: Assert that the returned object is not null and that the name attribute of the object is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method can handle empty strings without error and still returns a valid object, which is crucial for ensuring robustness in user inputs and data handling.

Scenario 4: Extremely Long Name Input

Details:
  TestName: testExtremelyLongNameInput
  Description: Test the method's capability to handle very long strings as input without failing or truncating the input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string that is longer than typical use cases, e.g., a string of 1000 characters.
  Act: Invoke the of method with this long string.
  Assert: Assert that the returned object is not null and the name attribute of the object matches the long input string.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method can handle unusually long inputs, which is essential for verifying the method's robustness and ensuring it does not impose unexpected limits on input size.

Scenario 5: Name With Special Characters

Details:
  TestName: testNameWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test checks if the method can handle names containing special characters and spaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string with special characters and spaces, e.g., "John @ Doe #123".
  Act: Invoke the of method with this string.
  Assert: Assert that the returned object is not null and the name attribute correctly includes the special characters and spaces.
Validation:
  This test is significant for ensuring that the method accurately processes and retains special characters and spaces in the input, which might be necessary for certain applications or data sets.
