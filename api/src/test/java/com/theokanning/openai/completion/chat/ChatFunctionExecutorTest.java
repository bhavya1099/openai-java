================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: The executor method takes a Function as a parameter, which could potentially be exploited if the function passed can be manipulated or if it's not properly validated.
Solution: Ensure that any Function passed to the executor method is properly validated and sanitized. Avoid passing user-controlled data to this method.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: If the executor method is used to process untrusted data, it could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution.
Solution: Never deserialize data from untrusted sources. If the use case requires it, consider using safe deserialization libraries that prevent arbitrary code execution.

Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: If the executor method is used to download and execute code, it might be vulnerable to tampering if integrity checks are not performed.
Solution: Always perform integrity checks on any downloaded code before execution. Use digital signatures or checksums to verify the integrity of the code.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Valid requestClass and executor function

Details:  
  TestName: testValidRequestClassAndExecutor
  Description: This test checks if the executor method works correctly when a valid requestClass and executor function is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Class object and a valid Function object.
  Act: Invoke the executor method with the created Class object and Function object.
  Assert: Assert if the returned Builder object is not null and if the internal state of the Builder object (i.e., parameters and executor) is correctly set.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the executor method correctly processes the input parameters and sets the internal state of the Builder object correctly. The expected result is based on the correct functionality of the executor method.

Scenario 2: Null requestClass

Details:  
  TestName: testNullRequestClass
  Description: This test checks if the executor method handles a null requestClass correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null Class object and a valid Function object.
  Act: Invoke the executor method with the null Class object and Function object.
  Assert: Assert if a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the executor method throws a NullPointerException when the requestClass is null. This is expected because the executor method does not perform any null checks before using the requestClass.

Scenario 3: Null executor function

Details:  
  TestName: testNullExecutorFunction
  Description: This test checks if the executor method handles a null executor function correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Class object and a null Function object.
  Act: Invoke the executor method with the Class object and null Function object.
  Assert: Assert if a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the executor method throws a NullPointerException when the executor function is null. This is expected because the executor method does not perform any null checks before using the executor function.

Scenario 4: Null requestClass and executor function

Details:  
  TestName: testNullRequestClassAndExecutorFunction
  Description: This test checks if the executor method handles null requestClass and executor function correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null Class object and a null Function object.
  Act: Invoke the executor method with the null Class object and null Function object.
  Assert: Assert if a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the executor method throws a NullPointerException when both the requestClass and executor function are null. This is expected because the executor method does not perform any null checks before using the requestClass and executor function.
