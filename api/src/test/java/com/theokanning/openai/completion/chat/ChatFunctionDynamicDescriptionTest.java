================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-497: Exposure of System Data to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
Issue: The current code does not validate the input received in the 'description' parameter. This can lead to exposure of sensitive system data if the input is not properly sanitized.
Solution: All input received from users should be validated and sanitized before use. Use a library like Apache Commons Validator to validate and sanitize input data.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The 'description' field is not explicitly declared as private, which means it can be accessed directly by other classes in the same package. This can lead to unauthorized access or modification of the data.
Solution: Declare the 'description' field as private and provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify it. Use the @NonNull annotation from the Lombok library in the setter method to ensure that the 'description' field is never null.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If any debug code is left in the application, it can expose sensitive information or system details to an attacker.
Solution: Ensure that no debug code is left in the application. Use a static analysis tool to detect and remove any leftover debug code.

Vulnerability: CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
Issue: If resources are not properly managed, it can lead to resource leaks which can degrade system performance and can potentially be used for denial of service attacks.
Solution: Ensure that all resources are properly managed. Use the 'try-with-resources' feature of Java to automatically manage resources.

  Scenario 1: Testing with a valid description string

  Details:  
    TestName: testDescriptionWithValidString
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method can successfully set a valid description string and return the Builder object. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid description string.
    Act: Invoke the description method with the valid string.
    Assert: Assert that the returned Builder object is not null and the description is set correctly.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method can successfully handle valid input and set the description correctly. In the context of application behavior, it ensures that descriptions can be correctly assigned to objects.

  Scenario 2: Testing with a null description string

  Details:  
    TestName: testDescriptionWithNullString
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a null description string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null description string.
    Act: Invoke the description method with the null string.
    Assert: Assert that the returned Builder object is not null and the description is set to null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method can handle null input and does not throw a NullPointerException. In the context of application behavior, it ensures that objects can be created even without a description.

  Scenario 3: Testing with an empty description string

  Details:  
    TestName: testDescriptionWithEmptyString
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles an empty description string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty description string.
    Act: Invoke the description method with the empty string.
    Assert: Assert that the returned Builder object is not null and the description is set to an empty string.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method can handle empty input and does not throw an error. In the context of application behavior, it ensures that objects can be created with an empty description.
