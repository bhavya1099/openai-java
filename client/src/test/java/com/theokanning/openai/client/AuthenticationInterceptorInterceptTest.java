================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
Issue: The token used for Authorization in the header of the request is directly concatenated. This can lead to exposure of sensitive information if the token is not properly protected.
Solution: Ensure that the token is stored and handled securely. Consider using secure methods for storing and retrieving sensitive information. Avoid logging sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The method throws a generic IOException, which might expose sensitive information through error messages.
Solution: Catch the specific exceptions that can be thrown and handle them appropriately. Avoid returning raw exceptions to the user.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Plaintext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: Sensitive data (token) is being transmitted over a network request. If this transmission is not done over an encrypted connection (HTTPS), it exposes the data to eavesdropping attacks.
Solution: Ensure all network requests transmitting sensitive data are done over secure channels, typically HTTPS.

"""
  Scenario 1: Valid Token Test

  Details:  
    TestName: validTokenInterceptTest
    Description: This test is meant to check the interceptor's ability to handle requests with a valid token.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a Chain object and a valid token.
    Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock Chain object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Response object is not null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the intercept method can process requests with a valid token and return a Response object. This is significant as it ensures that the application's authorization mechanism works as expected.

  Scenario 2: Invalid Token Test

  Details:  
    TestName: invalidTokenInterceptTest
    Description: This test is meant to check the interceptor's ability to handle requests with an invalid token.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a Chain object and an invalid token.
    Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock Chain object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an IOException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the intercept method throws an IOException when processing requests with an invalid token. This is significant as it ensures that the application's authorization mechanism correctly rejects unauthorized requests.

  Scenario 3: Null Token Test

  Details:  
    TestName: nullTokenInterceptTest
    Description: This test is meant to check the interceptor's ability to handle requests with a null token.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a Chain object and a null token.
    Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock Chain object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an IOException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the intercept method throws an IOException when processing requests with a null token. This is significant as it ensures that the application's authorization mechanism correctly rejects unauthorized requests.

  Scenario 4: Empty Token Test

  Details:  
    TestName: emptyTokenInterceptTest
    Description: This test is meant to check the interceptor's ability to handle requests with an empty token.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a Chain object and an empty token.
    Act: Invoke the intercept method with the mock Chain object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an IOException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the intercept method throws an IOException when processing requests with an empty token. This is significant as it ensures that the application's authorization mechanism correctly rejects unauthorized requests.
